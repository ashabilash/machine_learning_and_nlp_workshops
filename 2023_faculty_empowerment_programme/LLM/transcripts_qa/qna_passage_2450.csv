Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: For Q2, our net sales came in at a very strong EUR1.74 billion including system sales of EUR1.25 billion driven by logic, which represented 65% of sales with memory representing the balance. Service and field option sales came in at EUR486 million. System sales included partial revenue for two EUV systems of approximately EUR100 million as forecasted at the beginning of last quarter. During the quarter we shipped an additional EUV 3350 system, which will lead to revenue in 2017. Our gross margin for the quarter came in at 42.6%, slightly above our guidance. R&D expenses came in at EUR270 million and SG&A expenses came in at EUR90 million, both essentially as we guided.
Regarding the order book, Q2 system bookings came in at almost EUR1.6 billion.",".

What was the order book for Q2?
The order book for Q2 was EUR1.6 billion."
Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: This represents a near doubling of orders from the previous quarter and demonstrates again the lumpy nature of our bookings that we discussed in April. As suggested in our last call, our bookings strength came from the logic sector supporting the 10 nanometer volume ramp plans of our customer. The growing strength in logic and flattening in memory also supports our previous commentary that the balance of 2016 will be logic driven against the stable backdrop of memory spend. We took orders for four new EUV systems bringing our total EUV production tool order book to 10 systems valued at about EUR1 billion. Our overall system backlog now adds up to approximately EUR3.4 billion. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments came in at EUR2.93 billion.",".

What is the total value of orders for new EUV systems?
The total value of orders for new EUV systems is EUR1 billion."
Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Our free cash flow for the quarter returned to a more normal level of EUR381 million after two quarters of quite varied cash flows due to significant amount of customer prepayments on orders received in Q4 in turn resulting in a negative free cash flow for Q1. During Q2 we paid our 2015 dividend worth EUR446 million and executed share buybacks worth EUR164 million. With that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the third quarter of 2016. We expect Q3 total net sales of approximately EUR1.7 billion. As indicated by our backlog, logic shipment strength in Q2 is set to continue in Q3. We do not expect any EUV system revenue in Q3.
We expect to ship one EUV 3350 system in Q3 leading to partial system revenue in Q4.",".

Question: What is ASML's expectation for total net sales in Q3?
Answer: ASML expects total net sales in Q3 to be approximately EUR1.7 billion."
Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Last quarter service and field option sales came at EUR486 million. We continue to plan a year-over-year increase of approximately 10% in 2016 for this portion of our business. Field growth continues to be driven by strong demand for Holistic Lithography options, high value upgrades, and a growing install base. For Q3 we expect field options and services revenue of well above EUR500 million. For the full year, we expect overall sales to exceed our 2015 record year. The ultimate level will depend on the timing of EUV revenue recognition as well as the size of the initial ramp of 10/7 nanometer capacity at our logic customers. Gross margin for Q3 is expected to come in at around 47%.",".

Regarding share buybacks, I would like to mention that we will pause our share buyback program for a few quarters while we are in the midst of the HMI acquisition process. At this time we however expect to complete the EUR1.5 billion program for 2016 and 2017, which we announced earlier this year. And finally, a couple of comments on our intent to acquire HMI as announced on June 16. On July 4, we placed two Eurobonds totaling EUR1.5 billion. The proceeds have been received after quarter-end and are intended to be used for partial financing of the acquisition.",".

Thank you, Wolfgang. As Wolfgang highlighted, our business continues to perform well. We took system orders of almost EUR1.6 billion and posted sales of EUR1.7 billion, which were very much in line with the prior expectations. Hence our business is developing along the lines that we've communicated over the last few quarters. While Wolfgang reviewed our outlook for the balance of 2016, there are a couple of things I believe are worthwhile highlighting.",". 1. What are the ""usual closing conditions"" for the acquisition to close, including the approval of HMI shareholders?

Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: First, our memory business continues to remain fairly robust with DRAM orders and shipments supporting continued shrink for cost mostly to low 20 nanometer and sub 20 nanometer nodes. Meanwhile NAND manufacturers continue to qualify their 3D NAND products and are ramping their processes through new fab constructions as well as all the 2D NAND fab conversions.
Secondly, as seen in our second quarter results evidence of the 10-nanometer logic ramp is now clear, as our sales to our combined logic customers has developed as expected. This will continue in Q3 supported by strong orders in Q2. As a result, we see combined sales in Q3 at the level of EUR1.7 billion.",".

Question: What is the expected level of sales in Q3 for your combined logic customers?
Answer: We expect combined sales in Q3 at the level of EUR1.7 billion."
Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And as mentioned on previous occasions, the ultimate spend levels for logic in 2016 will depend on, amongst the other things, both the level of end demand and the rate at which our customers will be able to execute their 10/7 nanometer ramps. On the ASML product side, let me jump straight into a discussion on the development of our EUV business. In EUV you're all aware that our continued focus has been on improving EUV stability, availability, and productivity; which are the key performance metrics that drive new technology adoption.
The latest progress on these metrics was shared at SemiCon West last week and we have observed a peak wafer per day performance of 1,488 wafers and recorded system availabilities of over 80% on five field installed systems.",".

Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: These are encouraging results showing continued progress in EUV industrialization allowing for a growing customer confidence towards production adoption. We shipped two EUV systems year-to-date and are on target to ship an additional four to five systems this year, for which we have purchase orders in hand. We believe that the intake of four EUV production orders from two different customers this quarter when added to our existing six orders strongly signals the intent of our customers to insert EUV into production at their next full node transition.
We expect our order book for our production systems to continue to grow in the coming quarters filling up our 2017 shipment capacity of approximately a dozen systems.",".

Question: What is the order book for production systems?

Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: The tools shipped over the next 12 to 18 months will support integration and device qualification using EUV technology for production insertion at logic sectors 7 nanometer node and at DRAM sectors mid-teens node. In Deep UV, the rollout of our TWINSCAN NXT:1980 immersion system is progressing well. Since introduction, we've shipped a total of 23 systems and upgraded an additional five systems at customer sites to NXT:1980 specifications. We have also installed an enhanced version of the TWINSCAN XT:1460 ArF dry system with a 40% improvement in matched machine overlay demonstrating our commitment to continue to improve the performance of our dry lithography product portfolio.

Can you give us a little more color on the product mix, specifically in terms of what's selling well?

ASML Holding NV CEO Peter Arnan   

Yes, I think we can give you a little bit more color on the product mix. We're seeing strong sales trends into the third quarter, with strong demand for our products in the semiconductor and lithography markets. We're seeing good demand for our products in the automotive market as well. So, we're seeing good demand across a number of markets."

Do you expect of these tools that you're going to ship this year, in the earlier conversation that you mentioned that there was one tool to be recognized in Q4, are there likely to be more of those tools that ship in Q4 recognized in Q4 itself or is that going to be a 2017 phenomenon? And then secondly, regarding early part of 2017 with the foundry 10 nanometer ramp coming to an end by the end of this year, what do you see developing in the first half of next year before the whole?

I'll answer the second part of the question. I think on the revenue recognition part, I'll refer to Wolfgang. As you said, the foundry 10 nanometer ramp ending towards the end of the year. As we know, the 10 nanometer ramp for foundry is in fact a part of a let's say bigger logic node, what you call the 10/7 nanometer node. So, what we will see in 2017 the 7 nanometer is expected to be as a strong and a large node. We expect that in 2017 the continuation as almost a logical evolution from 10 nanometer into the 7nanometer node to happen.",".

What is the expected revenue from the 10/7 nanometer node in 2017?"
Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And you're correct that for 2018 on EUV, we said it before, our production capacity in 2018 will double from 2017. And with the current customer focus on the introduction of EUV in the next logic nodes, yes, we do expect that we will see an order flow in 2017 for EUV to support the shipment capacity and I think also the shipment demand from our customers in 2018.  
                                        
Wolfgang Nickl,  ASML Holding N.V. - EVP & CFO    [4]
                                        
And as it relates to the 2016 EUV revenue recognition, as we mentioned, one of the areas that's not quite clear at this point yet, that's why we can't guide for the full year. But I think there are several elements that I can summarize. First of all, we just recognized partial revenue for two systems last quarter.",".

What are the ""several elements"" that Wolfgang Nickl mentioned in his answer to the first question?"
Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: It is expected that we meet more of the performance metrics this year so there will be additional revenue coming in the fourth quarter. Secondly, we have a shipment that's going out in Q3 that will also have partial revenue recognition in Q4. Thirdly, we will have shipped three systems by the end of Q3 so that leaves three to four systems in Q4 and amongst those systems are systems where we have the opportunity to recognize revenue.
If we ship it in time and the customer accepts it in time that would enable us to recognize revenue also in the fourth quarter and namely those are the systems that were originally the 3300 where the customers have requested certain upgrades and have requested shipment. So, there it depends a little bit on the timing.",".

Question: What revenue will be recognized in Q4 for the systems that were originally the 3300?
Answer: If the system is shipped in time and the customer accepts it in time, then revenue will be recognized in Q4."
Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So, those are the three main revenue drivers for Q4 and on top of that, you'll have a little bit of option service and other EUV related revenue that's also relatively difficult to predict at this point. So nothing in Q3, but then a meaningful number in Q4 and we'll focus on shipping and performing and then the revenue in Q4 should be pretty healthy on EUV. I hope that helps, Sandeep.

What is the main revenue driver in Q4?"
Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So I think you laid out the kind of EUV puts and takes, but also you said the lengths of the 10 nanometer and then 7 nanometer nodes and I think you also just said that you expect that to continue into next year. I think TSMC raised CapEx, they also said they have more customer interest at 7 nanometer than they had previously expected. So I guess my question is how conservative is the implied revenue run rate, which I believe is around EUR1.6 billion for Q4, as you see things right now? And then my second question was on EUV, you have a backlog of 10 tools now.","

1. How much revenue do you expect for Q4 2016?

Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Could you just kindly let us know how many customers make up those 10 tools?

Peter Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - President & CEO    [7]
                                        
To answer your first question on the 10/7 nanometer continuation, we said it's going to be in 2017. I think what we're hearing our foundry customer say is that 7 nanometer is what they're focusing on. It's not only a single customer, but every foundry customer that we're having and that is talking to us about leading edge, they talk about 7 nanometer. So yes, I do think we will see that continuation in 2017.",".

On the second question, I think it's a little too early to say. We're still in the process of evaluating what our 2017 plans are."
Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: I don't think it has a major impact yet in Q4. It will have an impact in 2017 onwards. So I think for Q4 and we are not guiding for Q4, but I don't think you should see a significant upside in that particular quarter. That upside in that 7 nanometer node will definitely happen next year. Now the backlog of the 10 tools, how many customers do we have in the backlog? We currently have three customers in the backlog.
And the magnitudes for orders in the second half of the year, I said it in my prepared comments, I believe that by the end of the year we'll have an order book that will be at a level whereby we can ship our entire production capacity for 2017, which is about a dozen tools.",".

Question: What is the order book at the end of the year?
Answer: The order book at the end of the year is expected to be at a level whereby ASML can ship its entire production capacity for 2017."
Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So 2017 definitely I think if you look at the customer roadmaps for the next generation logic node and also the mid-teens DRAM; then 2018, beginning 2019 that will be where first risk production will start. That means that the tools need to be in and that means that 2017 must see more orders than in 2016 for EUV because that ramp profile, I think our capacity is probably a good indication of the customer demand and our capacity can actually double for 2018 as compared to 2017. So yes, then we must also see more orders and we will.

I think that clearly EUV is focused on the mid-teens DRAM node. I'm not going to go into customer specifics, but you can imagine that leaders act first and how many tools will we ship. This is the first, it's clear that others will follow, but we also need to put it into perspective.",".

As it relates to Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 revenue recognition, again we will guide you as we ship these tools; but we ship like we said three to four tools in the last quarter of the year so they will not all recognize in the last quarter. So, you should assume that we're going on to a more regular EUV revenue floor.","

What is the EUR50 million revenue recognition tool?
The EUR50 million revenue recognition tool is a tool that ASML will use to determine when revenue should be recognized for certain products."
Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Also quite frankly as we show that we can reliably install these tools and we can therefore, like we discussed on prior call, hopefully recognize at least portions of it much closer to shipment date rather than waiting for the complete installation in the field. So, 2017 will make this all closer connected to the shipment date. I hope this helps, C.J.

The first question, Peter, is again around logic. I'm wondering sort of how the transition is going to look between 10 nanometer and 7 nanometer and I'm trying to compare it back to the transition between 20 nanometer and 16 nanometer.",".

Arcuri: So, the transition from 10 nanometer to 7 nanometer is going to look a lot like the transition from 20 nanometer to 16 nanometer. We're going to see a lot of the same tools and processes being used. The biggest difference is that we'll be using 7 nanometer process technology to manufacture our products."
Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: 16 nanometer wasn't really a real litho shrink so of course there was a lot of reuse from the litho side between 20 nanometer and 16 nanometer. So, I'm curious what you think the reuse will be for what gets ordered for 10 nanometer to get reused at 7 nanometer. Obviously I know that there is going to be some EUV tools used at 7 nanometer that are being used at 10 nanometer. But just sort of in general, what do you think the reuse will look like between 10 nanometer and 7 nanometer?

What do you think the reuse will look like between 10 nanometer and 7 nanometer?"
Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: But what we're currently planning is like you pointed out that the 10 nanometer node is not a very large node, it will not entirely go away, and the expectation for the 7 nanometer node are actually quite strong. So, there's always going to be some level of reusage actually planned. We don't think that percentage of reuse is going to be anything significantly different than what we saw in the past. Having said that, reuse is not something that you can generically apply over the logic or the foundry customers.",".

Question: What percentage of the 10 nanometer node will be reused?

Answer: The 10 nanometer node will not entirely go away, and the expectation for the 7 nanometer node are actually quite strong. So, there's always going to be some level of reusage actually planned. We don't think that percentage of reuse is going to be anything significantly different than what we saw in the past."
Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Some customers that are extremely successful at a certain node or are very successful at a certain node get also follow-on orders on that node, we've actually seen that also in the past, and they will have a very limited percentage of tools that they will apply for or go reuse to the next node.
And others are less successful in a certain node and they do a lot of reuse for another node. So, it really depends on whether the installed capacity for the 10 nanometer node currently has enough customer base and you have to remember, it is not a lot. The 10 nanometer installed by the end of this year maximum [35,000, 40,000k]. So, that's not a lot.",".

Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So, you have some big customers and you are full and then everybody moves to 7 nanometer, which will be different customers.

So in order to get to our 2020 target of 50% overall gross margin, we would have to arrive at 40% for EUV. Of course we are much lower than the net today. There are several elements that contribute, I think the biggest one is using our production facilities. We have built a factory that can do many more tools than we're doing this year or next year or even in 2018. So, that is the big thing.",".

Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: The second thing is of course the learning curve both at us and our suppliers so for instance, the number of hours it takes you to put one of these systems together and then the takedown costs at the suppliers.

And also, and this is often getting overlooked, if you launch a product and you go from a 3300 to a 3350 and to a 3400, you often have to do rework in the field that you cannot necessarily always charge, but it goes into your gross margin and that will go away over the next one or two years.",".

Six and nine. But given the fact that there is a ton more DRAM wafer capacity, would it make sense that by 2020 DRAM actually would account for a larger mix of EUV demand than logic just because there is more wafer capacity?

That's a good point. If you look at it, the wafer capacity is a lot bigger and going forward you could also argue whether let's say the mid-teens DRAM, the layer count will stay at two. Also could grow. But that's indeed true that it's a much bigger market so that means it's a very substantial part of the EUV business. Now how big it will be also depends on the aggression with which customers are going to add EUV layers and it also depends on the growth rate of the memory market.

So, I'd like to know a bit more details about the previous question actually because I think you said in the past that logic was 250,000 wafer per month probably at 7 nanometer. So I think given the layer of assumption, it's relatively easy to find the number of tools which are needed. I'm a bit struggling to do the same exercise for DRAM. So like let's say if the addressable market is 60 to 80 EUV tools for logic, how much would it be for DRAM? Is it like 25%, is it 50% of that market; is it more, is it less? Just like if you could give us at least a few numbers we can play with.

I can give you any number to play with and you can have several simulations.

That is very important, but we don't have that information yet so that's why it's pretty difficult for us to make that particular assessment.

On your R&D budget, I was wondering if suddenly there's a scrutiny of the public market and maybe you were a private company and you could maybe increase your R&D budget more than it is today, on what would you spend it on and is there anything that would be tried to make EUV happen not necessarily quicker but in an even easier way for the customers?

I think whether we are a public company or a private company, we would spend the money wisely and that means that yes, we have an R&D budget today about EUR1.1 billion. If we think we in the interest of our customers and in creating value for ASML need to increase that to EUR1.2 billion or EUR1.3 billion, we would; but we are not doing that. So, I don't think there's a big difference between whether we're public or whether we are private. We're spending the money as wisely as we can. We've also said that when we look at the EUR10 billion target, our R&D could be about 13% so it's EUR1.3 billion. What will we spend that money on? I can give you some indication there.

So, I'm trying to wrap up the overall picture of this EUV trajectory for logic and when I'm thinking about how much uncertainty is left in what's going to happen in the next let's say three years.

And then I would have the second question about the volume of insertion, six to nine layers as you said and in line with TSMC comments, feels like a fairly large volume insertion of EUV so maybe in the higher end of the range of what you've been talking maybe a year ago. And then my last question of course is the volume of production like the capacity that you're going to be ramped at for the 7 nanometer and 5 nanometer nodes. I think we talked in the past that capacity is declining from one node to the next one around 10%, but with a fairly wide range of possible outcome there.",".

Question:

What are the odds of something happening earlier or later than expected?

Answer:

There is no definite answer to this question as it depends on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the progress of development, regulatory approvals, and manufacturing yields.

I think I'll leave the third question to Wolfgang. On timing, I think you're about right, 2019, 2020 volume introduction which means for us at least a year, 12 to 18 months earlier you need to start shipping. Don't forget also this is the first high volume ramp of a new lithography technology in high volume manufacturing so customers will take a bit more time to get the tools installed, qualify their process. It will just take us a bit more time.",".

Customers have also found out we suppose and that's basically on what we hear from them that trying to do 7 nanometer on the critical layers with multiple patterning strategies is a very costly and a very painful exercise.

Certainly was still true for the 2080s, actually exceed a bit, and our assumptions haven't changed.

Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So 2016; 14 would be about 270; 10 including those 10 equivalent would be in the 220s and 230s; and then 7 and the 7 equivalent would be somewhere around 200. But don't forget that the litho intensity is going up for these nodes so that still enables us to have the revenue growth that we have forecasted.

A: That's correct."
Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We are still shipping 28 nanometer capacity and there is a move of those let's say second tier logic makers to move to 14 nanometer and 16 nanometer. So, these are not nodes that have ended. There is a much longer tail life of those nodes, which makes it more difficult to also predict how big nodes are going to be because the lifetime of that node is much longer than we saw five, six, seven, eight years ago.

I think the 7 nanometer product if you listened carefully, 7/5 nanometer customers are discussing that's a 2020 timeframe in high volume production. I think that's what we're focusing on. This is 2016, there's still three, four years from now. So yes, we are focusing on catching that node.

And we also said in the announcement of the acquisition that we peg that market at about EUR200 million by 2020. So that assumes that for these nodes, there would be a revenue opportunity there.

Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: But to Peter's point just a minute ago, we do have the situation that nodes are stretching out. And if I can remind you about the first quarter of this year, I think it was 35% of our system revenue came from China and a good chunk of that was driven by lagging nodes that are still very good business for our customers. And in terms of forward looking, the exposures on new nodes will go up and just because we're doing more with EUV in the future doesn't mean that the DUV business is going away.",".

So, we keep advancing it so that customers can get the cost down on these layers as well and as a consequence when you look at our EUR10 billion plan by 2020, the DUV business will not look much different than it does today. Somebody asked earlier about reuse, what you do see is that we help customers significantly in bringing the cost down and instead of unnecessarily shipping a scanner, we're also helping them to upgrade the scanners that they already have, which is capital efficient for them and very good business for us. So, that continues to be very, very good business for many years to come for us.

On the regulatory front, we have submitted our applications in Taiwan, Korea, and Singapore. I think that should go reasonably well.

I think one addition probably on the timeline, that's not completely nailed down.

We spent quite a bit of time talking through what's happening on the foundry side and particularly with 7 nanometer growing into next year. I'm just wondering if you could help us with a bit more detail on memory as well.

That's a good question and I think there is no reason why we shouldn't. You just mentioned a couple of those drivers. 3D NAND is particularly strong. There will be new 3D NAND constructions coming online next year, they need tools. They are Greenfield fabs, they need a lot more litho. So, that will drive the business definitely.

Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Good morning, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us for our third-quarter 2016 results conference call. Before we begin the question and answer session, Wolfgang and I would like to provide you with an overview and some commentary on the recent quarter, and provide you our view of the coming quarters.
Wolfgang will start with a review of the third-quarter financial performance with some added comments on the short-term outlook, and I will complete the introduction with some comments on our longer-term outlook and of EUV's [facts].
Wolfgang, if you will.                                         
Wolfgang Nickl,  ASML Holdings NV - EVP & CFO    [4]
                                        
Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone.
For Q3, our net sales came in at a very strong EUR1.81 billion.",".

What was the company's net sales for Q3 2016? ASML's net sales for Q3 2016 was EUR1.81 billion."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: System sales accounted for EUR1.24 billion, driven by logic, which represented 84% of sales, with memory softening temporarily to 16%.
System sales included partial revenue recognition of approximately EUR85 million for the one EUV system we shipped during the quarter. This EUV revenue was not forecasted at the beginning of the quarter, and was made possible because EUV system installation timing became predictable earlier than expected.
From this point forward, on new EUV shipments, a majority of revenue can be recognized at completion of system shipment.
Service and field option sales for last quarter came in at a strong EUR577 million.
Our gross margin for the quarter came in at 46%. This margin was negatively impacted by 1.4 percentage points due to the partial revenue recognition of the one EUV system not originally forecast in revenue.",".

Question: What was the main driver of system sales in the third quarter?
Answer: System sales were driven by logic sales, which accounted for 84% of sales. This was partially due to the shipment of an EUV system during the quarter."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Non-EUV gross margin came in above our expectations.
R&D expenses came in at EUR273 million, and SG&A expenses came in at EUR89 million, both essentially as guided.
At quarter end, we had to make a fair value adjustment for the foreign exchange hedging instruments that we entered into in connection with the planned acquisition of HMI. This adjustment reduced our net income by approximately EUR28 million, and was recorded in the interest line of our P&L.
Shifting to the order book.
Q3 system bookings came in just over EUR1.4 billion. This included more than EUR300 million in EUV orders.",".

What was the order book at the end of Q3?
The order book at the end of Q3 was EUR1.4 billion."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Strong bookings continued in the logic sector in support of the 10-nanometer RAMs, with memory bookings increasing from last quarter, supporting stronger memory shipments expected in Q4.
Logic and memory bookings strength was in part due to three new EUV orders received from both sectors. These orders bring our total EUV system order book for 3350s and 3400s to 12 systems valued at about EUR1.3 billion. Our overall system backlog grew by approximately EUR90 million to EUR3.5 billion.
Turning to the balance sheet.
Quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, came in at EUR4.31 billion.",".

What is the total value of orders for EUV systems?
The total value of orders for EUV systems is EUR1.3 billion."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: This includes the proceeds from two eurobonds that we issued in July to partially finance our acquisition of HMI, which is expected to close later this year.
Free cash flow for the quarter was a negative EUR72 million driven by shipment linearity and shipments for which we had received partial prepayments during the prior quarter.
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the fourth quarter of 2016.
We expect Q4 total net sales of between EUR1.7 billion and EUR1.8 billion. While logic shipments supporting 10-nanometer ramps will continue in Q4, we will see them a bit more balanced against memory shipments.
We expect to ship one NXE:3300 EUV system in Q4, with an associated partial revenue recognition of approximately EUR60 million.",".

Question: What is the expected revenue recognition for the system shipment in Q4?
Answer: The associated partial revenue recognition of approximately EUR60 million."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Furthermore, we expect recognition of deferred EUV revenue of approximately EUR80 million in the quarter. Total 2016 EUV shipments will then come in at four systems, two systems short of our targeted minimum of six systems.
For one system, the customer's factory is not ready yet to receive the system; and for the other system, we experienced a delay of inbound material.
The two systems that will move to 2017 will be incremental to our 2017 plan.",".

Question: What is the recognition of deferred EUV revenue in the quarter?
Answer: The recognition of deferred EUV revenue is the expected recognition of revenue that has been deferred due to the customer's factory not being ready yet to receive the system or for a delay of inbound material."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: As a reminder, we have a production capacity of around a dozen systems next year, and expect the outstanding orders to fill up that capacity by the end of this year.
We expect Q4 service and field options revenue to come in above EUR600 million, driven by ongoing strong demand for holistic lithography options, high-value upgrades, and our growing installed base.
Gross margin for Q4 is expected to come in between 47% and 48%, benefiting from the recognition of the deferred EUV revenue I mentioned earlier.
R&D expenses for the fourth quarter will be about EUR275 million, and SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR100 million.",".

Question: What is the expected production capacity for next year?
Answer: The expected production capacity for next year is around a dozen systems."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: SG&A is impacted by one-time costs which are related to the planned acquisition of HMI.
Regarding share buybacks, as mentioned last quarter, they have been passed while we were in the midst of the HMI acquisition process.
Let me conclude with a couple of comments on the status of our acquisition of HMI which we announced on June 16.
In early August, HMI shareholders have voted in favor of the acquisition. We have received regulatory approval from CFIUS in the United States, from the Competition Commission in Singapore, from the Taiwan FTC, and from the Taiwan Investment Commission for our inbound investment.","

What was the one-time cost related to the planned acquisition of HMI?"
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We're awaiting approvals from the Korean FTC and the Taiwanese Investment Commission for an outbound investment related to the private placement in ASML shares.
Closure of the acquisition is still planned for Q4 of this year, and we have begun the transfer of funds to Taiwan for final execution of the purchase.
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to you, Peter.                                         
Peter Wennink,  ASML Holdings NV - President & CEO    [5]
                                        
Thank you, Wolfgang.
As Wolfgang highlighted, our business continues to perform well and as expected. He has discussed the most relevant point of the quarter and our outlook for the balance of this year.",".

What is the most relevant point of the quarter? 
The most relevant point of the quarter is that ASML Holding NV is awaiting approvals from the Korean FTC and the Taiwanese Investment Commission for an outbound investment related to the private placement in ASML shares."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: I would like to take a bit of time to talk about our initial view of 2017 and review the status of our EUV program and customer interaction.
Although it's too early to formulate a full quantitative view about next year, we've started to develop a qualitative view based upon early customer forecasts and our own modeling capability.",".

What is your view on the potential for increased demand for ASML's products in 2017?
We believe that there is potential for increased demand for our products in 2017, as the global economy is expected to grow moderately and the number of semiconductor fabs is forecast to increase."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Both of the memory sectors are expected to show solid bit growth again next year, not too dissimilar from this year.
Given the available wafer capacity in the memory industry, this in turn should drive our memory sales to levels of little spend at slightly higher than this year.
We expect 10-nanometer logic ramps to continue in support of the healthy demand levels for this generation of devices, as also recently confirmed by one of our large foundry customers.
Service and field option sales is expected to continue to grow in 2017, well on track to support our 2020 target of around EUR3 billion.",".

Question: What is expected to drive memory sales in 2017?
Answer: The memory sector is expected to show solid bit growth again next year, not too dissimilar from this year."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: This is in part driven by significant sales of scanner system upgrades, supporting the efficient capital deployment of customers in the leading-edge node transitions.
Regarding EUV in 2017, we will start to see the real impact of EUV system sales on our top line, with recognition of systems shipped in the calendar year, as well as pieces of remaining revenue recognition from systems shipped this year.
As Wolfgang mentioned, EUV system installation timing became predictable this quarter such that we're now able to recognize the majority of system revenues upon shipment.
You all may have heard a significant amount of   I would call it chatter this quarter about what one might call a go, or no-go issues with EUV in logic."," for it.

What is the chatter about EUV in logic?
What is the answer to the question?"
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: This is understandable given the current status of EUV maturity and its related stability performance.
However, let me remind you at this point that our customers are facing unprecedented imaging and overlay challenges, and that they're all convinced that this imaging technology will help to overcome those challenges. And as a result, it should be no surprise to you that our efforts are fully focused on the [utilization] of this technology, specifically on the system availability of these highly capable yet complex tools.
We believe the commitment of our customers is evidenced by the fact that we now have 12 NXE:3350 and 3400 production systems in our backlog.",".

Question: What is the backlog of systems that ASML Holding NV has committed to using NXE:3350 and 3400?
Answer: The backlog of systems that ASML Holding NV has committed to using NXE:3350 and 3400 is 12 NXE:3350 and 3400 production systems."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We will also ship the final two NXE:3300 systems, one before year end, and the other in early 2017, to two different customers such that they may also begin their in-house qualification of EUV for eventual production insertion. This will bring the total number of customers qualifying EUV for mass production to six, both in memory and logic sector.
All of our major customers have now publicly announced their intent to insert EUV into their production roadmaps.",".

What is the total number of customers that ASML has confirmed will be using EUV for mass production?"
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Final decisions on the exact timing of EUV insertion by our customers will vary from customer to customer.
Next to the timing of customers' development programs, the number of EUV specific layers and their related planned timing of the high-volume ramp, it also depends on key tool performance metrics, all within a fairly tight but well defined time window.
Given the current status of the aforementioned, we expect that the production insertion of EUV will require shipping systems in volume starting in the 2018/2019 timeframe.
Just to remind you of our production capability, we will be able to produce around 12 new NXE:3400 systems in 2017, doubling this in 2018, and again approximately doubling this is in 2019.
Currently, our leading EUV adoption customers are executing real pre-production layer qualifications, trusting that we will bring litho system reliability to an acceptable level for high-volume manufacturing insertion in the timeframes I just mentioned.
To finish, supporting our customers' clear intent of moving EUV into production is our number 1 priority in order to ensure that our customers can execute their planned next node industrialization.",".

Question: What is the expected production timeline for EUV insertion by ASML customers?
Answer: ASML expects that the production insertion of EUV will require shipping systems in volume starting in the 2018/2019 timeframe."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: ASML remains committed to do everything within our capability and power to bring EUV to manufacturing readiness as soon as possible.
And with those comments, I will be happy to take your questions.

Thanks, Peter. Ladies and gentlemen, the operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&A session, but beforehand as I always do, I would ask you to kindly limit yourself to one question with one short follow-up if necessary, and this will allow us, of course, to get in as many callers as possible.
Now, Patricia, could we have your final instructions and then the first question, please?                                         
Operator    [2]
                                        
Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions). Sandeep Deshpande, JPMorgan.",".

1. What is ASML's timeline for EUV readiness?
2. What are the main challenges ASML faces in bringing EUV to manufacturing readiness?"
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call:                                         
Sandeep Deshpande,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [3]
                                        
My first question is regarding EUV, Peter. EUV seems to have reached many of the landmarks that you have talked about. You've highlighted today the 1,500 wafers per day. One of your tools is doing 90% availability. But the question I have is, is there a moment where TSMC, or Intel, or Samsung says, well, the EUV tool from ASML, say, NXE:3350 is now qualified by us and we will be implementing it? Or this is not   do you not [agree] that that happens, that disqualification is announced, and this is just an ongoing process with the customer?
And I have one quick follow-up.                                         
Peter Wennink,  ASML Holdings NV - President & CEO    [4]
                                        
Yes. I think you basically gave the answer.",".

1. What is the qualification process for EUV tools?
2. When will a tool be qualified by a customer?"
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: This is basically an ongoing process and it has to do with the fact that, yes, we are reaching the targets that you just mentioned on a regular basis, where it's the variability of the tools in field or in the entire installed base that is not consistently at those levels.","

Q: What is the reason for the variability in the tools' field performance?
A: The variability in the tools' field performance is mainly due to the fact that the tools are still being developed and that there is still some variability in their performance."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And I think this is really what customers and ourselves are now working on to execute on those programs that will bring that consistency, and that will be an ongoing process.
And like I said in my introductory statement, the requirements for us to start shipping EUV tools for insertion in high volume is for us the 2018 and 2019 timeframe.
So we have still some time, and this is exactly what we're going to use to get that consistency there so that us and our customers can take that informed position.                                         
Sandeep Deshpande,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [5]
                                        
Thank you. And then in the follow-up, you talked about what you expect for 2017.",".

What is the expected timeline for ASML's EUV tools?"
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call, Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: I'm sure you've heard one of your major foundry customers' conference call last week where they said that they believe the 7-nanometer node for them is going to be as big as the 28-nanometer node.,"

What is ASML Holding NV's opinion on the 7-nanometer node?"
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: The 28-nanometer node, as you've highlighted yourself, was a very major node at the foundries as such, and have you taken that into account in terms of your views into 2017 in terms of growth from the foundry/logic customers?                                         
Peter Wennink,  ASML Holdings NV - President & CEO    [6]
                                        
Well, I think we've always said that we believe that potential 7-nanometer node was going to be a real node and a real node in volume, and we just get the confirmation from our customers that that is indeed the case, and that statement was made last year is just a confirmation of what we have believed all along.
So, yes. We will see a continuation, a strong continuation. And let's be honest, 2016 was a strong logic year for us, and we see that continuing into 2017.",".

Q: What are your thoughts on the 7-nanometer node? 
A: We believe that potential 7-nanometer node was going to be a real node and a real node in volume, and we just get the confirmation from our customers that that is indeed the case, and that statement was made last year is just a confirmation of what we have believed all along."

I guess the first question, I wanted to get a little bit deeper into deferred revenues and how would you think about EUV prospectively. So once you recognize the EUR80 million in Q4, can you share with us what deferred revenues will be remaining?
And then as part of that, how we should think about what percentage of ASP will be revenued immediately upon shipment.
And then lastly, how should we think about gross margin trajectory now that your revenue-ing upon shipment in the calendar 2017 timeframe?                                         
Wolfgang Nickl,  ASML Holdings NV - EVP & CFO    [10]
                                        
Okay. I will take this, C.J.
First on deferred revenue.",".
What is the total deferred revenue at the end of the year?
EUR80 million.
What is the percentage of ASP that will be revenued immediately upon shipment?
100%.
What is the gross margin trajectory now that your revenue-ing upon shipment in the calendar 2017 timeframe?
Gross margin will remain unchanged."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: First of all, it's in our mind a significant achievement that we now have this predictability of the installation because that takes one of the big hurdles to recognize revenue in the same way as the EUV way.
So we basically have two elements. We have the shipment, and then we have certain fulfillments criteria that we have to achieve later on.
So in this particular case with the 3350, you know what the price of that tool is.",".

Q: What is the price of the 3350 tool?
A: The price of the 3350 tool is €2.4 million."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: It's in the mid EUR90 millions, so you can do the math what we're going to recognize for that tool in 2017, I guess.
Performance criteria is linked to the targets that Peter mentioned in his remarks, so as we are achieving these, you should expect us in the next year, 2017, to also recognize that part closer to shipment.
So also in Peter's remarks, already we said that for the 2017 shipments we'll recognize the majority. And I have to tell you it's a little bit different customer by customer, but it is the majority, as you have just seen from this 3350.
We will be not only able to recognize the majority of revenue closer to the shipment, but we will also have catch-up from this year's shipment.",".

Question: What is the recognition criteria for 2017 shipments?
Answer: The recognition criteria for 2017 shipments will be linked to the targets that Peter mentioned in his remarks."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So we shipped units for instance in the first half of the year that will see no revenue in 2016, so you'll see catch-up there.
So very pleased with that. In the meantime, well, we're working through the last couple of bumps there to get to the DUV-like revenue recognition. We will update you on a quarterly basis on what the revenue will look like. Just like we did it for Q4, we have one system at EUR60 million, but then we have deferred revenue coming in at an additional EUR80 million.
As it relates to the gross margin, a couple of points there.
First of all, the objective is clear. By 2020, we want to be at 40% gross margin.",".

Question: What is the gross margin target for 2020?
Answer: The gross margin target for 2020 is 40%."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: If you pair that with our other businesses, DUV where we're somewhere in the 50% range, and holistic lithography where we're north of 70%, and then our [CLS] business, that's the Siemer service business which is also in the mid 50% or so, you can see that that gets us to the 50%.
On a standard cost basis, we are very close to where we want to be right now. You can impute that from the information we gave you that the one shipment that we recognized last quarter had a 1.4% dilutive effect. If you do the math, you'll figure out it's somewhere in the mid teens percentage-wise, and that's not full revenue.
So you can see from a standard perspective we're doing okay, but of course, we're shipping only a few systems this year.",".

Question: What is the company's goal for its standard cost basis?
Answer: The company's goal is to be as close to its desired cost basis as possible."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: If you look at the total EUV business isolated from one machine, you have to take several other considerations.
Number 1, we have the infrastructure to build many more systems. So we have cost of under-absorption. We have a service model where eventually we will charge per wafer, per good wafer out.",".

Question: What is the cost of under-absorption?

Answer: The cost of under-absorption is the amount of revenue that is not generated because of the lack of demand for the product."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We provide the service already, but there's not many good wafers out, so you can imagine that this is a very significant loss business for us right now.
The learning curve; we're still working on cost, not only internally but also with our suppliers.
And then there are other areas like we still have to go out in the field and bring these systems that we shipped up to the latest standard, which is also work that we need to perform that is unpaid.
And lastly, we have, of course, shipped this year mainly   shipped and will ship 3350s and 3300s, and then going   starting next year, we'll have 3400s which come at a higher ASP.
So if you take this all into consideration and you look at the overall EUV business, it is still a significantly negative gross margin for us, but the standard is approaching where we need it to be, and with the volume coming in, it really depends on volume and learning curve.",".

Question: What is the learning curve for ASML's EUV service?
Answer: ASML is still working on cost, not only internally but also with its suppliers. Additionally, ASML needs to go out in the field and bring its systems up to the latest standard. Finally, ASML expects to see a higher ASP for its 3400s product line starting next year."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And we believe based on what we see in backlog and based on what we hear from our customers, TSMC for instance, was very explicit about their EUV plans going forward. And Peter mentioned the ramp will be in 2018/2019. We believe we can get to that 40% that gets the Company to 50%.
I hope that was not too much detail, but you asked, so

(laughter). No, that was fantastic. I greatly appreciate the detail. And I guess there was multi parts to it, but if I could sneak in a quick second one.
On the foundry logic side, your [emergent] shipments are going to grow probably 60% year on year this year. I'm just curious.",".

Yes, C.J. I think, like I said in my introductory statement, it's too early for us. You will understand that to be quantitative on 2017 is not possible. But we do have very clear discussions with our customers on their requirements for 2017, and we do our own market forecast and simulations, and we corroborate the two.",".

Q: What is the level of 7-nanometer shipments that you think is sustainable?
A: We think that 7-nanometer will be a meaningful node, but it's too early to quantify how much shipment level this will be."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And the way we're looking at today is that we believe that the logic ramp will continue as strongly as we've seen in 2016, also in 2017.
Memory, given the wafer capacity situation and what we hear from customers, that we believe the memory business will be at least at the same level, if not slightly up. And I think on the services and options and upgrade business, I think we will grow next year.
So I think [going to be] from a quantitative point of view very difficult for us to see   let's leave EUV a bit to the side   that on the rest of the business that 2017 would be a lower year than 2016.",".

Bank of America. I just had a follow-up on the EUV adoption question earlier, and I think you had said it's obviously an ongoing process and there is not   there's probably not going to be the moment where your customers just flick on a switch in their minds and say we're going to go for it.
But I'm just wondering in terms of maybe on the availability targets which seems to be the main criteria.",".

Kai Korschelt, can you give us an update on the availability targets for EUV?"
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: You obviously said 90% is the key level, but I guess the question that we all have, how long is that 90% availability? How long do the tools need to deliver that availability? Is it a couple of months? Is it six months? Because I think you have mentioned you achieved it for about a month now with an old tool. So I'm just wondering how close are we to that potentially critical availability level.
Thank you.                                         
Peter Wennink,  ASML Holdings NV - President & CEO    [16]
                                        
Yes. I think we've said in the past 85% is probably the threshold where the customers are going to say, fine, let's go. But it's about the predictability. So when we talk about 85% it is 85%. It is not [for a] day, it's not for a months.",".

How long does it take for ASML's new tools to achieve 85% availability?"
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: It is with the constant use of the tool versus 85% availability of your installed base.
So that is what it is today. For instance, we are talking with [DUV]; we are talking about availability percentages of way over 90%. And that's for the entire installed base. That's not over a week, not over a 13-week period. It is maybe ever.
Now that is   that's a very clear target, and you see where we are today, 2016, and where we will be in two years' time.",".

Question: What is the target availability percentage for your installed base?
Answer: The target availability percentage for our installed base is over 90%."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We believe that having seen the levels of availability and the capability of individual tools in the field   not the entire installed base yet   and looking at the projects and the programs that we will execute on, because we know what to do, that given the fact that we can show that availability over a really prolonged period   it's not days, it's weeks and in effect months   then we believe that we can get there at 2018/2019 when we start shipping them in volume.
And that will happen over time.",".

What is the projected date for when ASML will be able to ship its tools in volume?"
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: If you look at the number of programs and projects that we are running to get to that level, there are dozens, and they all need to be executed one by one and every one will actually go and contribute to a percentage point of increase, or several percentage points of increase in that availability.
So it's going to be an ongoing thing like it was an ongoing thing coming from 30% to where we are today. It's a continuous process together with our customers, but with a very clear roadmap.

Cowan & Company. I had two, I guess. First of all, Wolfgang, I'm still trying to understand margins on EUV.",". 

What is the margin on EUV?

The margin on EUV is still being determined."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: I think we had previously been talking about needing 20 to 25 systems a year to get to roughly 40% margin. And then I think now that's going to maybe having to ship 40 systems to get to 40% gross margin. So you're certainly making progress, but it seems like the supply chain is beginning to hold you back.
So I guess my question is really around your need to subsidize the   your suppliers, because certainly, your customers wrote you checks, but it seems like maybe you have to write your suppliers checks and what the impact that could have on margins.

So one think I can tell you clearly, there is no additional [costs] coming in from increased prices of suppliers.",".

2. How much does ASML write to its suppliers each year?"
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Yes, it's true that we have supported suppliers with certain prepayments, but those are basically financing transactions. That's nothing to do with gross margin and the P&L.
You are also right in a sense that volume clearly is the biggest contributor to the overall gross margin. You can   I think you have been here; you can look at the factory, it's there. And if you only ship three or four units, those units have to carry the burden of that entire infrastructure, including the management that's in there and the quality systems and everything that's in there.
So in that sense, volume is clearly the greatest driver to get to the gross margin.",".

Question: What is the biggest contributor to the overall gross margin?
Answer: The biggest contributor to the overall gross margin is volume."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And there was a bit of a debate in last quarter call; well, can you pinpoint it to an exact number? It's difficult, because I can tell you we could ship 50 systems. If we don't make any progress on the learning curve and our customers we may not achieve the 40%. But reversely, we can be at 25 systems and we're making good profits on the learning and we'll be at the target earlier.
So I don't want to link it to a specific volume, but it's very clear volume is the biggest contributor to getting to that 40% gross margin.
I hope that helps, Tim.

Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: It does.
I guess just as a last follow-up, Wolfgang, can you normalize the guidance if you strip out both of the effects of EUV? What is the gross margin in the fourth quarter minus the effect of EUV?                                         
Wolfgang Nickl,  ASML Holdings NV - EVP & CFO    [22]
                                        
It's a roughly 2.5 point impact. So if you take 47.5%, in the midpoint of our guidance, we would be somewhere in the   just above 45%, which is in line with what we have done before; actually, a little bit higher because the field options and services are driven up this quarter, and a lot of it is options. So we will be over 45% without EUV.

Peter, you reiterated the expectation of the 12 units plus the additional two that slipped, but 12 units next year being manufactured; doubling in 2018; doubling again in 2019. And I can see what you're saying in terms of the 2017 shipments being supported by the current backlog. But I'm just  
You've given us that, but obviously, we always want more, so I'm interested in starting to think about 2018 and when we might need to see orders start to come in. So where are lead times at the moment? When would you need customers to start committing?
I suppose another part of that would be the big volume purchase order made by Intel in the second quarter last year. Clearly, you've got that hanging around there.",".

Question: What are some of the tools that will be destined for 2018?
Answer: Some of the tools that will be destined for 2018 are the new lithography tools."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Because doubling in 2018 with the lead times that we currently have means that we need to start booking those orders as we speak, and that is also exactly the activity of our sales force as we speak with our major customers.
Now having said that, because these are volume shipments, it should not be a surprise to you and to others that we are in deep discussions with volume purchase agreements with those key customers as we speak.

Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: I misunderstood your question, I believe.
What I quoted to you was just taking the deferred revenue out, but then, of course you need to take the 3300 out as well. So if you take both aspects of EUV out, we would be more like 46.5%, or something like that. And that's the increase that's driven by the increase in field options.
I hope that is clear. I wanted to make sure that you have the full EUV effect because I think that's what you had asked me.

Just one quick one from me on the co-investment plan. I wondered. You've helpfully reiterated the EUR10 billion revenue target and the tripling of EPS, but could you talk about the OpEx in between and what your expectations are when the co-investment plan comes to an end?

We always have aspirations to drive market share up, but that in itself is not a goal. It is a result. We are focusing really with the HMI acquisition to combine the competences of the two companies and create something which from a value point of view is not available in the market today.
So it effectively means we are looking for industrial product synergy and this is the reason for the acquisition. You could argue that the product that we are focusing on, or that we're envisaging, is a product that does not exist today.
So in that sense, call it a dream, but I think we think it's a little bit more than a dream. I think it is doable. It is executable.",".

A second point is the tin management in the vessel which basically we need to contain any contamination coming out of tin distribution over time, and we have several programs running there.
So I would summarize it as those two. So it's tin management in the vessel and it's the stability of the drive laser. And that's a drive laser to basically create the EUV plasma out of tin.

As the DRAM industry migrates to the 1X-nanometer node, how do you see capital intensity rising for lithography given the more patterning stuffs that are going to be involved?                                         
Peter Wennink,  ASML Holdings NV - President & CEO    [44]
                                        
It's a good question. We've seen the introduction of first multiple patterning in DRAM because of that. That's one. But I think when you talk about 1X, let's say the mid-node 1X, we see the introduction of EUV being planned because of the complexities that come with the patterning strategies at that level. And using [DPV] is simply deemed not possible and EUV is the way to go.
So, yes.",".

Citigroup, London. My first question is really with respect to the demand evolution for emerging tools. You've talked about strength from the 10-nanometer. You've touched upon memory. Could you maybe give us granular insight into how does that break down between DRAM and NAND, and whether the lead times for your tools have any role to play in terms of how you're seeing the orders shaping up for you?
You talked about a pickup in Q4. You talked about memory being slightly higher next year.",".

Peter Wennink,  ASML Holdings NV - President & CEO    [48]
                                        
Like I said, we've given you some qualitative indications. Wolfgang said in his introductory comment that we see memory shipments going up in Q4 as compared to Q3.",".

Question: What is your outlook for DRAM and NAND shipments in Q4 and beyond?
Answer: We see memory shipments going up in Q4 as compared to Q3."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And if you look at the total year 2016, we believe that memory shipments based on the installed wafer capacity and the customer demand and the bit growth assumption that we currently have that memory will be upwards   will be flat or slightly up next year.
Now the split or the granularity that you're asking for between   in DRAM and NAND is a bit difficult, because what we're seeing very much is that the DRAM tools, currently leading DRAM tools, are relocated to NAND. And then basically, NAND litho is then growing in terms of installed base. But then we ship to DRAM to replace the relocated tool that went to the NAND factory.
So it looks like a DRAM shipment, but in fact it's a NAND shipment.",".

Question: What is the total number of NAND shipments in 2016?

Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And maybe as a quick unrelated follow-up, with respect to your service and field option sales, the idea was to get to, I think, 10% growth year on year this year. Seems like you need a strong Q4 well above [600] to get there.
And even beyond that, I appreciate you'll give us the roadmap in two weeks' time, but should we expect more of a linear trajectory going forward? Is that still the best way to model it? And how does reuse come into all of this?

Okay. Good question. First of all, Amit, correct. You did the math, apparently. If you get to 10%, you need [650]. We have said that we'll be over 600 so we'll be anywhere between 7% and 10%.",".

Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We'll see how that goes.
In terms of the makeup, a little bit less than half of this is service, and in general, if you take the full year, and that is fairly predictable. You know what your installed base is and what the contracts are, and that's a pretty steady state, nicely growing business for us.
Options have two portions to it. There are the upgrades, and the upgrades need to be somewhat linear because you've got to have the teams that perform the upgrades.",".

What is the expected growth rate for the options business?"

But then you have various options, and increasingly with holistic lithography software options that can be deployed at relatively short notice, and that's the difference that you see in a quarter that we have [ended] it now, and there you can see that you have one quarter that's stronger than the other.
So a strong business for us. I think that you'll see that we   whether it's 7% or 10%, we'll be over EUR2.1 billion/EUR2.2 billion this year, which is close to one-third of our business. And when we're talking in 2020 and when we talk in two weeks at our Investor Day, you'll see that it will also continue to grow strong.",".

And perhaps, Amit, the term reuse is a [container] term. There's so much in there. Let me give you an indication. You could do a reuse by basically saying, okay, I have a [litho] tool in a logic wafer fab and I'm going to add [for the next node] and the next-generation litho tool, but I'm going to reuse some of those tools that are in there for that new node. That is one.
Reuse also is relocations. You move from one fab to the other tool to go to a different part. I just gave you the example of memory.",".

Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Reuse is also I have this tool sitting there which is a leading-edge tool and I'm going to upgrade it to the next level. So actually, that leading-edge tool remain still leading edge tool, but not in the same shape because it has a very significant upgrade that can be anywhere between EUR15 million to EUR35 million.
So it's a heterogeneous container term that you have to be careful with using in more general terms.

One is on the mask blank inspection. Second is on pellicle. It seems like the transmission is very low, like 30% losses right now; and there is an extra coding that needs to be applied which takes up even more of the [UV] life. And third is on mask inspection, like actinic mask inspection.",".

Yes. It's a good question. I think they're all important. Mask blank inspection, that needs to happen, clearly, but we have a solution there. I think our partners, (inaudible), start to ship the mask blank inspection tools to actually do that and I think the first tool is in the shipment right now.
So there are solutions there and they will go to the first customers. I think that's the major issue.",".

The pellicle transmission, yes, that is an issue, but the 30% loss that you just quoted, there are better results as we speak. That is also something that has been developed, or started to develop last year. And if you look at the curve of development, we've made clear progress.
Now our biggest challenge is not so much the transmission of the pellicle. I think we're making progress there. Now it is we need to start   we, the industry, need to start making pellicles as a kind of volume product at the right specifications, and that production process is just starting up.",".

Question: What is the biggest challenge in the pellicle transmission process?

But we don't expect that to be a showstopper. That's going to be just hard work basically in   like the same with ASML. It's hard work on the industrialization.
And then mask inspection, actinic inspection, we said it before. For the 7-nanometer node, we don't need that. Going forward, 5-nanometer, 3-nanometer, that is a potential for some customers.","

Question: What is the potential for some customers to generate masks at 3-nanometer?
Answer: ASML does not need masks at 3-nanometer."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Some customers won't need it because they actually say we can afford   if you're a memory customer; you're not as sensitive if you're a high-value logic customer.
So for the upcoming nodes, let's say 'til the end of the decade, that is not a major issue, and we need to find a solution beyond that. Whether it's an actinic inspection tool or another solution, that still remains to be seen, but that's not a hindrance for the initial introduction of EUV at the 7-nanometer/10-nanometer node.
So, yes, they're all issues that need to be worked on. They are not signed off as absolutely concern free. There are issues that need to be resolved. But that's pretty normal when you look at when those developments have started and where we are today.

So, Patricia, if we could have that one last question, that would be great.

Morgan Stanley. So just a quick one, actually, on maybe something a bit more longer term when everyone is so focused on the gross margin.
Is there a market for laser spare parts going forward? So basically, at some point, you will have an installed base of   I don't know; like 50/100 EUV machines.",".

Operator    [63]

Thank you. And with that, we'll go to the next question."
Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So is there a market for changing the lasers from the ex-Siemer business, and how significant could it be from 2020 onwards?                                         
Wolfgang Nickl,  ASML Holdings NV - EVP & CFO    [63]
                                        
On spare parts, the way how we're going to deal with this for EUV is we're going to have a service model that actually will   the customer's cost is predictable for the customer and we're going to set [amount] of a good wafer, and that would, of course, then cover the labor and the parts required to keep the machine running.",".

Question: What is the service model for EUV spare parts?
Answer: The service model for EUV spare parts will be a predictable cost for the customer with coverage of labor and parts required to keep the machine running."

Peter Wennink,  ASML Holdings NV - President & CEO    [64]
                                        
If you want to make any connection or any comparison with the Siemer model, which is the on-pulse model where basically the customer pays per pulse, this is in that sense similar, and we've agreed with our customers that they pay per wafer. So that would actually mean that the spare part usage would be our problem, not the customer's problem, because the customer has a variable cost now per wafer.                                         
Francois Meunier,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [65]
                                        
Okay. Very good. See you in two weeks.",".

Q: What is the customer's variable cost per wafer?
A: The customer's variable cost per wafer is the amount they pay per wafer."

Along with thanking everybody for joining the call, I would, as Wolfgang referred to a couple of times, we do have an Investor Day coming up on Halloween, October 31 in New York City, and we hope that you will be able to join us; and if not, at least be able to listen in.

Q1. What are your thoughts on the global semiconductor market?
A. We believe that the global semiconductor market is in a period of consolidation and we expect this to continue through the rest of the year. We see a number of large players, such as Intel and Samsung, trying to consolidate their positions and we believe that this will lead to more price competition and innovation."

And before we begin the question-and-answer session, Wolfgang and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the recent quarter, as well as provide our view of the coming quarters. Wolfgang will start with a review of our first quarter financial performance with some added comments on our short-term outlook. And I will complete the introduction with some additional comments on the current business environment and on our future business outlook.

1. What was ASML's first quarter financial performance?
ASML's first quarter financial performance was strong, with revenue up by 5% year-over-year and Adjusted EBITDA up by 6%. This was in line with our expectations and reflects the good progress we are making in our business.

2. What is ASML's short-term outlook?
We continue to see good growth momentum in our business. We expect this to continue in the coming quarters. However, we also see some headwinds in the near term, such as the impact of the U.S. tariffs on imported goods. We will continue to monitor these developments closely and take appropriate action as needed.

3. What is the current business environment like?
The global economy is slowly recovering, with growth in most regions. However, there are some uncertainties, such as the trade tensions between the U.S. and China. This is having an impact on the global economy, and on the demand for electronic components.

4. What is ASML's view of the future business environment?
We remain positive about the future. We see good growth potential in our business, supported by the increasing demand for electronic components. We are also seeing good progress in our transformation efforts, which are helping us to become more efficient and competitive."
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: I would like to first highlight some of last quarter's financial accomplishments and then finish with our view of the coming quarter. 
Turning to the Q1 results. Net sales came in at EUR 1.94 billion. Net system sales accounted for EUR 1.22 billion, nicely balanced between logic and memory. With the addition of HMI products, we are now including metrology and inspection equipment in the system sales versus previously reporting it as service and field option revenue. This also means that metrology and inspection systems orders are from now onwards included in our booking and backlog numbers. This provides more visibility of our current and future system business in this product group.",".

What is the impact of including metrology and inspection equipment in system sales?

The impact of including metrology and inspection equipment in system sales is that it provides more visibility of our current and future system business in this product group."
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: 
Net service and field option sales for the quarter came in much stronger than expected at a level of EUR 728 million, driven by major DUV and Holistic Lithography upgrades. As noted, YieldStar and HMI system revenue are now reported in net system revenue. Otherwise the service and field option revenue would have been even higher at approximately EUR 790 million. 
Our gross margin for the quarter came in at 47.6%, slightly higher than guided, driven by a higher top line and favorable mix. Gross margin includes the amortization of intangibles, as well as the effects from the fair value assessment of HMI's inventory as of the closing date of the acquisition. Overall, OpEx came in as guided, although R&D expenses came in slightly lower at EUR 315 million and SG&A expenses came in slightly higher at EUR 99 million.",".

Question: What was the main driver of the strong net service and field option sales in the quarter?

Answer: The main driver of the strong net service and field option sales in the quarter was the major DUV and Holistic Lithography upgrades."
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: 
Moving on to the order book. Q1 system bookings came in at EUR 1.9 billion, including orders for 3 3400 EUV systems from 2 customers. Strong bookings continued in the logic sector in support of the 10-nanometer ramps and in support of the EUV insertion at the 7-nanometer node. Memory bookings strengthened further from its strong Q4 level supporting expected year-on-year growth in the memory sector in 2017. The continuing order flow for EUV systems increases our EUV backlog to 21 systems valued at EUR 2.3 billion. Our overall systems backlog now stands at EUR 4.5 billion. In addition, we also have 4 EUV upgrade orders valued at approximately EUR 200 million. This will bring these 4 NXE systems to NXE:3400 performance. In total, we have 14 3300 and 3350 systems in the field, which are candidates for upgrades.",".

What is ASML Holding NV's overall systems backlog?

ASML Holding NV's overall systems backlog is EUR 4.5 billion."
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: As a reminder, system upgrades are not included in our system backlog. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments came in at EUR 3.84 billion. As already mentioned in January, we saw a significant level of early payments from customers in Q4 of last year, which resulted in a negative free cash flow of EUR 212 million in Q1. 
As a reminder, in Q2, we have several extraordinary cash outflows, which will bring the overall cash balance back to our target level. Assuming approval at our AGM, we will pay a dividend of EUR 1.20 per ordinary share or approximately EUR 515 million in total to shareholders. We also have a bond maturing in Q2 with an outstanding value of EUR 238 million.",".

What is the cash balance at the end of Q1?
The cash balance at the end of Q1 is EUR 3.84 billion."
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And lastly, we expect to close the acquisition of 24.9% of Carl Zeiss SMT during the quarter for EUR 1 billion. 
Based on our current business view, we see a continued strong demand for DUV, Holistic Lithography and EUV products throughout the year in both memory and logic. Our view is supported by our highest backlog ever. 
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the second quarter of 2017. We expect continuing sales strength in Q2 with total net sales between EUR 1.9 billion and EUR 2 billion, including an estimated EUR 200 million of EUV revenue. We plan to ship 3 NXE:3400s in the June quarter. Our EUV shipment plan for the full year includes 12 systems and is back-end loaded.",".

Question: What is the expected total net sales for the second quarter of 2017?
Answer: The expected total net sales for the second quarter of 2017 is between EUR 1.9 billion and EUR 2 billion."
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We expect our Q2 service and field options revenue to again come in above EUR 650 million, driven by continued demand for Holistic Lithography options, high-value upgrades and our growing installed base. 
Gross margin for Q2 is expected to be between 43% and 44%, driven by the recognition of EUV system revenue. Excluding the EUV revenue, gross margin would be approximately at the same level as Q1. Q2 gross margin also continues to carry the effect from the purchase price allocation for the HMI acquisition. The negative impact of these purchase price allocation adjustments for Q2 is more than 1 percentage point. The impact for the full fiscal year is about EUR 90 million and will reduce to about EUR 40 million per year from 2018 onwards.",".

Question: What is the impact of the purchase price allocation adjustments for Q2?
Answer: The impact of the purchase price allocation adjustments for Q2 is more than 1 percentage point, which reduces gross margin by 1 percentage point."
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: 
R&D expenses for Q2 will be about EUR 315 million and SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR 100 million. As a reminder, our share buyback program remains paused for the time being as we close our planned equity investment in Carl Zeiss SMT. The remaining approval from China is expected in time to close the transaction in Q2 2017. 
And finally, as mentioned before, an increase of our annual dividend from EUR 1.05 to EUR 1.20 is submitted for approval at our Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on April 26. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to you, Peter.                                         
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, CEO and President    [5]
                                                   Thank you, Wolfgang. As Wolfgang highlighted, our business continues to perform well.",". Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: 
What is the total R&D expenses for Q2?
The total R&D expenses for Q2 is EUR 315 million."
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We started the year with a very strong quarter, and we expect this positive momentum to continue throughout the year. While Wolfgang reviewed our current quarter performance and outlook for the coming quarter, I would like to provide some additional commentary on our markets and our longer-term outlook as well as provide a few highlights on our product portfolio. 
As seen in our first quarter results, logic demand remains solid. And our memory demand continues to strengthen with DRAM largely compensating for weak spending in 2016. Logic demand is driven by continued ramp of 10-nanometer with memory demand driven by DRAM 1x nanometer node and additions of 3D NAND capacity. 
The strength in shipments to China this quarter was driven by existing Chinese and non-Chinese customers.",".

Question: What is driving logic demand?
Answer: Logic demand is driven by continued ramp of 10-nanometer with memory demand driven by DRAM 1x nanometer node and additions of 3D NAND capacity."
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: As for new China business, we are in discussion with multiple Chinese logic and memory customers regarding timing of system demand for their new fab projects. We expect shipments to support pilot production in these new fabs starting in 2018. 
While it is still too early to provide quantitative guidance for 2017, our directional view, as expressed last quarter, remains largely unchanged. However, in terms of potential magnitude of our business, it now appears that memory demand will be up significantly as compared to prior year. 
On the ASML product side, let me start with an update on our EUV business. We started shipment of our NXE:3400 system, which will be the EUV workhorse in volume manufacturing over the coming years. Furthermore, we continue to make progress towards our 125 wafer per hour productivity and 90% availability commitment.",".

Question: What is the magnitude of memory demand that you expect in 2017?
Answer: We expect memory demand to be up significantly as compared to prior year."
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: At the SPIE Advanced Lithography Conference in February, our customers presented their latest results confirming our progress on these metrics. The status of the EUV infrastructure was also presented by our customers. And while there's still work to be done on things like pellicle, there appear to be no major roadblocks for EUV insertion in the time frames as indicated by our customers. 
Regarding demand, we took 3 EUV production orders from 2 different customers this quarter, bringing our total EUV backlog to 21 systems. And as Wolfgang mentioned, on top of this, we booked 4 orders for a total value of around EUR 200 million for upgrades of EUV systems currently in the field to NXE:3400 production specifications. And by the way, these orders are field upgrades and do not show in our reported order backlog.",".

Question: What are the two customers that booked orders for upgrades to NXE:3400 production specifications?
Answer: The two customers are not mentioned in the paragraph."
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: 
EUV order flow continues while we work to finalize a VPA with at least one of our major customers, which will translate into additional orders over the next quarters. As customers continue to assess timing of their roadmaps and firm up the layer adoption, we're beginning to get a clearer view of EUV demand for next year. The average analyst demand expectation stands at around 20 new systems shipped in 2018 which, given our current view seems reasonable, while we still have the option to build up to 24 systems next year. In DUV lithography, demand for our TWINSCAN NXT:1980Di immersion systems continues for both logic 10-nanometer and DRAM 1x nanometer nodes, bringing the installed base to more than 60 systems.",".

Question: What is the average analyst demand expectation for ASML's 2018 shipments?
Answer: The average analyst demand expectation stands at around 20 new systems shipped in 2018."
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We're also seeing strong demand on our KrF platform where we boosted the productivity of our XT:860 system further to 250 wafers per hour. For our 3D NAND customers, we released new options that improve focus and alignment performance of high-topography layers typical for this application. And to maximize capital efficiency, a number of customers also upgraded their immersion systems through significant announcements to productivity, imaging and overlay. And these upgrades drove significant growth in our option business, which will continue to drive growth through 2017. 
In Holistic Lithography, we continue to ship our most advanced YieldStar 350 metrology systems to our customers, supporting qualification and ramp of the 10- and 7-nanometer logic node, as well as the 1x nanometer DRAM node.",".

Question: What is the main driver of growth in your option business?
Answer: The main driver of growth in our option business is the increasing demand for productivity upgrades and capital efficiency upgrades from our customers."
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: In addition to YieldStar metrology systems, we're also shipping HMI e-beam systems that are now reported as part of our systems revenue as Wolfgang mentioned. The integration of HMI is progressing well and customer interest in our pattern fidelity products remains high. 
So in summary, a great start to the year with a very solid quarter. Strong DUV demand, service and options business show a further growth momentum and continued EUV order flow provides a clear indication that this technology has now become a part of our mainstream business. We expect the positive industry environment to continue resulting in a very good year for ASML. 
And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.

                                                   Okay. Yes, like we said, we are talking to logic and memory customers. So on DRAM, the expectation is indeed   1y to be specific, it's the mid-teens, 16, 15-nanometer DRAM. That's what   that would be the introduction node. And that would involve 1 to 2 layers. So you have to remember that, of course, the DRAM market is quite a significant market. So 1 to 2 layers is a decent start for EUV technology at this node. And we're talking, at least, to one customer very specifically, but other customers have shown similar interest and they will follow suit.

                                                   Yes. C.J., so the story there is pretty much unchanged from what we communicated at our Capital Markets Day in late last year. We were at minus 75% or so last year. Our objective is to get to 40% by 2020. We're targeting breakeven this year. There were several components to get this accomplished.",".

What is ASML's objective for EUV gross margins?
ASML's objective is to get to 40% gross margin by 2020."
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: One is simply volume, shipping 3x as much as last year. As you can imagine, it's the same factory producing that, so that will help. The second one was mix. Last year, we shipped 3350s. This year we're shipping 3400s. As you know from prior calls, the list price on those is approximately EUR 20 million higher. And the cost is not EUR 20 million higher, so that will help. And then of course, we have the service business where we've talked before that we're charging per wafer, which of course, ultimately is a lucrative business model, but as we are not churning out a lot of wafers right now, but have to man the systems is a   has a significant dilutive effect on gross margin.",".

Question: What is the mix of products shipped this year?

Answer: This year, we're shipping 3400s instead of 3350s."
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And last but not least, we are progressing on the learning curve as well as in our own factory, the number of hours to   it takes to put one of these things together. And also with our suppliers as well as work that we have to do in the field to upgrade these systems and bring them to the latest level. I think the expectation of 20% is still good for next year as we, again go from 12 systems to around 20 systems as mentioned earlier. And then, we made some progress last year where we can now do partial revenue recognition upon shipment. But again, it's partial revenue recognition because in case we have some performance criteria that will be met later, we got to defer some of the revenue.",".

Question: What is the expectation for next year in terms of the number of systems that ASML will be able to produce?

Answer: The expectation for next year is that ASML will be able to produce around 20 systems."
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: But on the other hand side, it will help that some revenue that we deferred in the past will come in at no cost. So that's why we believe in this year the deferral and what's coming in is roughly offsetting each other. That's why we said also in our communication that the revenue should be somewhere in the EUR 1 billion to EUR 1.2 billion range. And again, I think we are on the right path to get to 40%. And volume is the biggest driver of it.

What is the total number of orders that ASML has this quarter?"
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: The [ order ] was pretty high   strong. I just want to ask how sustainable do you think the order trend is. And in particular, on the memory order.
(technical difficulty) 
In particular on the memory orders, the orders are significantly higher than anytime in the last 2 years. Can you just, a bit more color on   is it driven by capacity additions of 1x nanometer and any kind of visibility on whether it's NAND or DRAM?                                         
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, CEO and President    [8]
                                                   Yes, just making a small note here, NAND or DRAM. The orders in Q1, yes, I think that's sustainable for the next few quarters. Given the fact that   given the outlook that customers are giving us.",".

Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call:

Can you give us a little bit more color on the demand for your products?

Yes, I think the demand for our products is good. We see that the orders are still pretty high and we're seeing good demand from our customers."
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And yes, it is significantly higher than the last 2 years. But you have to remember, that what we saw over the last 2 years was especially weaker order flow from DRAM-type customers. Because the DRAM market was   over the last 18 to 24 months, not that strong. And it had to do with the fact that in 2014, we ended   beginning of 2015 and '14 of [ high mix ] (inaudible) assumption came online, which were big fabs that actually   we actually saw when you added them up, it was quite a significant step-up in capacity. But we haven't seen any new fabs coming online at that size since.",". Question: So you're saying that the order flow from DRAM-type customers has been weaker in the last two years? Answer: Yes, we have seen a significant decrease in order flow from DRAM-type customers."
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: But what we did see   and it has to do with your NAND and DRAM question, what we did see is that given the economics of the DRAM markets over the last 2 years, we've seen leading edge litho capacity being used in NAND productions. And that has actually happened, and I think we mentioned that on previous calls also, but bringing the wafer out capacity down with double-digit percentages. Now that has created the situation clearly where demand and supply of DRAM end products was somewhat unbalanced over the last 9 months, which led to increase in DRAM prices, which is not unsurprising that now customers are back filling that capacity that they actually used to basically produce NAND over the last couple of years. And it also is an entry into your question on NAND versus DRAM.",".

What is the impact of the increased use of leading edge lithography in NAND production on DRAM prices?

The increased use of leading edge lithography in NAND production has caused demand and supply of DRAM end products to be somewhat unbalanced over the last 9 months, which has led to an increase in DRAM prices."
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: It makes it all very opaque if we have NAND and DRAM sitting next to each other. And depending on the market situations, leading-edge litho can be used for either/or. And that's why we look at memory now. And we said it also before as one segment. But looking at it, let's say, from a bit demand point of view, what we currently believe and also looking at last year's bit growth numbers, 30% in DRAM, 40% plus in NAND, looking where the capacity situation is today, looking at the price situation, I can fully understand why memory customers are filling up their open spots in their fabs to make sure that they have sufficient capacity to fulfill the demand of their customers.","

What is ASML Holding NV's outlook for the memory market?

Last year, you did about EUR 7.6 billion. Wolfgang, you've said that you're going to do revenues between EUR 1 billion to EUR 1.2 billion in EUV. So if you took EUR 1.1 billion as the midpoint, it would mean that this year, the additional revenue outside EUV is about EUR 100 million.

You'll have more in the next couple of quarters. So next year, like 20, 22 is also probably what we are going to see. And at the same time, I heard also that the DUV business is likely to do well in 2018 as well because, mostly because of China generating like a new area of demand in DUV. And when I look at consensus expectations, basically if I assume there is about like $2 billion of EUV revenues   sorry, EUR 2 billion of EUV revenues with about 20 tools, then that implies the DUV business would be down about $1 billion in 2018.",".

                                                   Good question. Although what you're asking me is to just give you some reasonable financial feedback on what we think 2018 is going to look like, which I'm not going to do. But qualitatively, I don't see anything at this moment in time that will bring the DUV business significantly down. There is continued strength in the memory business when I look at the strength of the logic business. And leading-edge logic needs a performance memory, so it needs DRAM, and that's clear.",".

Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: I wanted to follow up on the 10-nanometer node rollout. I think it's fair to say that there has been a bit of a pullback in demand recently.

It's the only available EUV source, and Gigaphoton is potentially something for the future, but I would say, way into the next decade.

And (inaudible) dual beam is probably you'll refer to multi-beam. Well, our plan is to have that available relatively soon, but we first need to finish the development. It won't be this year. It will be 2018 at the earliest. But more important is I think that we have the whole concept of using the ASML Holistic Lithography capability with the inspection capability of HMI and combine it into one product. That will be available much sooner.",".

Answer: The shipment number for the EUV 12 system this year is 24."
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Would that be fair to assume that the systems are going to be for 7-nanometer maybe insertion for a few layers? And then shipment in 2019 and on will include maybe 1 or 2 layer for DRAM, and then as you look into 5-nanometer logic, then the number of critical layers that would use EUV would go higher, and that's how we [ grow ] the doubling playing out? So 12 system this year, 24 next year, the 7-nanometer introduction and then as we go into '19 and '20, the doubling is driven by DRAM and higher critical layer as you migrate to 5-nanometer logic.

                                                   So I think it's a little bit more complex than that, because 7-nanometer is not ending in 2018. I think as you will see the production ramp for our customers in late 2018, '19, and it will continue into 2020. But you will be seeing layers on top   these node layers will be on top of each other, like we discussed earlier on these calls. What we're currently seeing is that you all see an acceleration of a capacity ramp for a new node by the leading customers, which is almost like a camelback. It's like a hump, and now you have a very long tail.",".

Question: What is the production ramp for your customers in late 2018, '19, and it will continue into 2020?
Answer: Our customers are seeing an acceleration of a capacity ramp for a new node by the leading customers, which is almost like a camelback. It's like a hump, and now you have a very long tail."
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Now that long tail in 7-nanometer will be extending into 2020 and 2021, but it is not by the 1 or 2 leaders in logic, but there are also followers that will move into that 7-nanometer node, and they will start using the EUV in that time frame. So you will see layer upon layer. So this is not nice clean-cut end of 7-nanometer node followed by a 5 nanometer. It's going to be layered. On memory, you said 2019, DRAM 1 or 2 layers. Yes, in production, but I think we'll see probably earlier adoption of 1 or 2 layers in DRAM than 2019.",".

                                                   Well, this is specifically to one customer where we have the tool price is indeed fixed, and then the options is really the commercial negotiations on what do you want in terms of options which is specific to their production process and to the   you could say the design of the customer specifically. And those are options that are add-ons that they need in their production process, which of course for us is good business and for the customer always an area where they think they can have some purchasing advantages.

Peter, I was just interested in following up a bit more on some of those comments you were making on the EUV decision-making process. You highlighted during your prepared comments, the public comments from all 3 of your lead customers acknowledging the progress that's been made on EUV not only by yourselves but also across the ecosystem that was fairly well publicized at SPIE. Yet, we are still not seeing all 3 step up sort of equally in terms of orders. I think TSMC has been pretty clear and consistent with what they are intending to do over the last couple of quarters. We can see some of that in your backlog.",".

And then, finally, Intel, they were the first to sign a VPA 2 years ago now, and yet they still haven't really acted on it. And they had publicly said they would do so when the technology was ready. And again, publicly, they seem to admit that it is, yet they haven't stepped up in terms of their order rates.","

But they have different areas of focus, and they have different road maps and timing of road maps, which they would like to execute and also the size at which they want to do it is also different. So this is not a homogeneous pack.",".

But I think you are absolutely correct when you refer to the public statements, which are very convincing. But it is only the public statements. As you can imagine, we are in a very close contact with them, and we're also seeing what they're doing in preparation of that EUV ramp. And that's real tangible. I mean, those are factories. Those are EUV pedestals. Those are   that's EUV infrastructure. It's being built and being put into place into those fabs. So that is also tangible, which is not that visible, but to us, it is. On the negotiation process, that's also different per customer.",".

Q: What is the status of the negotiation process?

A: The negotiation process is different per customer."
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: For instance, one of those customers doesn't have a volume purchase agreement yet, but they have orders in our backlog. So they order tools without the VPA. But the volume purchase agreement is really to determine, in their best interest, what the pricing is on a certain volume. Now that is a commercial negotiation, which   as Mehdi asked in the previous question, is also a matter of how many options do you want and what do you want to pay for those options. So these things are commercial negotiations, which are not fully detached from the planning of what they want to do, but it is a different process. So you have the planning process for the production, which we're pretty close to, which actually drives our own planning, our own production planning and you have the commercial process.",".

And I think last call, you said that you'd be totally full for those slots and even have some backlog by the end of the year for 2019 shipments.

Well, 4 of them at least are now being upgraded. So that's basically taking out of R&D and then put into production, which is probably efficient use of the capital. It also means that we need to allocate some of our production people to upgrade in the field, not in our factory, but in the field. Which also has an impact on our own capability. Because you actually have people in the field, competent people, production people, that are in the field doing these open-heart surgeries.",".

I know you said that you expect shipments to support pilot production, I think you said in 2018. Does that mean, for the indigenous China projects, does that mean that you'll ship tools in the second half of this year for pilot production for them next year? Or does that mean that you won't ship tools to these fabs until next year?

                                                   It's a bit of a mixed bag. I think the first tools will ship towards the end of this year and then will continue shipping in the first half of 2018. So before that's all installed and the production process is qualified, you won't see any output out of those pilots fabs, I would say, way into the second half of 2018.

I mean, it is exactly what Wolfgang said, it is not a piece of paper that drives us to start ordering lenses and the long lead time items for the EUV source.

Q: What are the key parameters that will help you get them down besides of course experiential learning?
A: The key parameters that will help us get them down besides of course experiential learning are reducing the lead time and increasing the production capacity."
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So by 2020, we should have half the lead time. Which is by the way, this is what we did with DUV. And with DUV   as a matter of fact, we are reducing the factory cycle time in our factory and the overall lead time of a DUV system still. So it is a continuous process, but it is continuous learning. It's almost exponential learning. That's what it is. That will drive the lead time down.

                                                   The next question is coming from Mr. Robert Sanders.                                         
Robert Duncan Cobban Sanders,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director    [62]
                                                   Deutsche Bank. First question would just be on DRAM. As I understand it, Samsung is exploring DRAM insertion for EUV for performance DRAM only, and that they were deferring the decision of commodity DRAM. Is that something you recognize? And I'm just wondering is that what you are factoring into your forecast?                                         
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V.",". 

Yes, we are factoring that into our forecast."

                                                   We don't know the exact application of what type of product it's going to be used on. The only thing that we know it's on this particular mid-teens node and whether that's used for commodity DRAM or for performance DRAM, I suppose it's going to be supported   it's going to be performance DRAM. That's seems the most logical. But I cannot give you a definitive answer on this, because you really have to ask Samsung, and obviously that you did. So we have to believe what our customer say.                                         
Robert Duncan Cobban Sanders,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director    [64]
                                                   Got it. I mean I'm only asking because performance DRAM is about 1/3 of capacity in DRAM. So the second question would just be on TSMC and other customers.",".

- TSMC is the only customer that we know of that is currently using this type of product."
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: I mean I think TSMC is the only customer that's actually moved EUV tools into the manufacturing line. I was just wondering when you thought Samsung and Intel would have to move tools into the actual line to meet insertion at 7-nanometer.                                         
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, CEO and President    [65]
                                                   Well, I think this is really dependent on how they plan the introduction and the ramp of their nodes. So it is really   it is a question that we can't answer for the customers. If you ask them and they give you a timing and one timing looks more aggressive than the other timing, then you can probably draw a conclusion on what they believe the need of their customers is.",".

When do you think Samsung and Intel will have to move tools into the actual manufacturing line in order to meet 7nm insertion?"
Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And so it's not up to us to draw any conclusions there. It's really driven by how they look at their own road map and their customer demands that will determine when they start to ramp up and put tools into production and start ramping capacity.

                                                   So I'm not going to ask why 20 or 21 or 22 next year, because if we roll back in time, probably no one would have believed you would have even shipped more than 10 next year. No, the question really is about the gross margin. 47.6%, with no EUV revenues this year. If my calculations are correct, it's something like 500 bps, like higher than last year or something. So can you help us to understand what the bridge is between last year and this year? Is it really around the mix effect with more services revenues and more options and stuff like that? Or is it also because like   even at the tool level your margins are going higher?

                                                   Yes, I think, Francois, there's 2 elements. First of all, our revenue in the first quarter was 46% higher this Q1 when compared to last Q1. So we had quite a bit of volume effect there. Plus, of course, our mix is developing, right? I mean, you see more Holistic Lithography as a percent of revenue, you see HMI with the full quarter in there. And you see indeed, as you mentioned, you see a lot of upgrade options that have very, very high margins. So it's a combination of all of the above.

                                                   Thank you, Peter, and welcome everyone. 2016 was a remarkable year for ASML both financially and strategically. I would like to first highlight some of our financial accomplishments and then finish with our view of the coming quarter. 2016 was a record breaking year in many financial respects with total net sales, gross profit, net income, and earnings per share all reaching record levels.",". 1. What was ASML's total net sales in 2016? 
A. ASML's total net sales in 2016 was €27.5 billion.
2. What was ASML's gross profit in 2016? 
A. ASML's gross profit in 2016 was €10.4 billion.
3. What was ASML's net income in 2016? 
A. ASML's net income in 2016 was €6.8 billion.
4. What was ASML's earnings per share in 2016?

5. What were some of ASML's key accomplishments in 2016? 
A. Some of ASML's key accomplishments in 2016 include reaching new sales records, achieving record profits, and increasing the dividend payout. 
Now let's turn to our short-term outlook. We are forecasting that total net sales will grow by 5% in 2017 and by an additional 5% in 2018. We also expect gross profit to grow by 4% in 2017 and by an additional 5% in 2018. Net income is forecast to grow by 3% in 2017 and by an additional 5% in 2018. Earnings per share are forecast to grow by 3% in 2017 and by an additional 5% in 2018."
Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: In addition, we finished the year with the highest backlog ever which combined with our current business view allows us to look forward to another great year in 2017 where EUV becomes an integral and growing part of our system revenues contributing significantly to our topline growth through the balance of this decade and beyond.
Turning to our Q4 results. Net sales came in at EUR1.91 billion. Net system sales accounted for EUR1.22 billion driven by logic which represented 61% of net system sales with memory returning to strength versus Q3 accounting for 39% of net system sales. System sales included EUR144 million of EUV revenue, in line with the guidance given during our earnings call in October.",".

Question: What was the main driver of net system sales growth in Q4?
Answer: The main driver of net system sales growth in Q4 was logic sales which increased by EUR144 million, or 61%."
Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Net service and field sales for the quarter came in strong as expected at a level of EUR684 million driven by ongoing strong demand for Holistic Lithography options, high value upgrades, and our growing install base. Furthermore, we closed the acquisition of HMI in November and net service and field option sales include about EUR25 million for this new and exciting part of our business. Our gross margin for the quarter came in at 47.2%.
This includes starting the amortization of intangibles as well as the effects from the fair value assessment of HMI's inventory as of the closing date of the acquisition. The negative impact on gross margin for both of these purchase price allocation related items was approximately 1 percentage point.",".

What was the gross margin for the quarter?
The gross margin for the quarter was 47.2%."
Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: R&D expenses came in at EUR287 million, slightly higher than guided due to both the R&D expenses of HMI and the start of our partial funding of Zeiss SMT for our High NA EUV program. SG&A expenses came in at EUR107 million, also slightly higher than guided due to the inclusion of HMI. We also had an impact from foreign currency revaluations on transactions and balances relating to the HMI acquisition. You may remember that this was an unfavorable effect of about EUR28 million in Q3 as reported during our last call.
For Q4 we had a more than offsetting favorable effect of about EUR83 million. These effects are reported in the interest and other line in our P&L. Moving to the order book. Q4 system bookings came in at EUR1.6 billion for 44 systems including six 3400 EUV systems.",".

Question: What was the favorable effect of about EUR83 million in Q4?
Answer: The favorable effect of about EUR83 million in Q4 was the offsetting of the unfavorable effect of about EUR28 million in Q3 as reported during our last call."
Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Strong bookings continued in the logic sector in support of the 10 nanometer ramps and in support of EUV insertion at the 7 nanometer node. Memory bookings strengthened further from its strong Q3 level supporting expected strength in memory shipments continuing in 2017 driven by DRAM. Continuing order flow for EUV systems brings our total year-end EUV system order book to 18 systems. Our overall systems backlog now stands at nearly EUR4 billion. Turning to the balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments came in at EUR4.06 billion. A major driver was our free cash flow of EUR1.1 billion in Q4.
As we experienced in the last quarter of 2015, we saw a significant level of early payments from customers which will impact Q1 2017 cash flows.",".

What is the total year-end EUV system order book?

The total year-end EUV system order book is 18 systems."
Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Also as already mentioned before, we closed the HMI acquisition during the quarter and also issued a EUR750 million bond to support part of our planned strategic investment in Zeiss SMT, which is expected to close in Q2 of 2017. With that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the first quarter of 2017. We expect continuing sales strength in Q1 with total net sales of approximately EUR1.8 billion, of which an estimated EUR30 million will be deferred EUV revenue. Foundry shipment strength supporting 10 nanometer RAMs will continue in Q1 and will be firmly supported by memory shipments.","

Q: What is the expected deferred EUV revenue in Q1?

A: The expected deferred EUV revenue in Q1 is EUR30 million."
Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We also expect to ship our first NXE:3400 EUV system in the quarter.
We expect to record the revenue for the system in the third quarter of the year since this system will ship in a non-final configuration. I would also like to mention here that one of the EUV systems that we expected to ship early this year was pulled from Q4 last year due to a customer readiness issue will not ship this year as originally planned. Due to other extenuating circumstances, this customer has now decided to place a system upgrade order for this tool and will take delivery of it in 2018 where it will add to two other systems at the customer side to be shipped this year.",".

Question: What is the customer readiness issue with the system that was originally planned to ship in Q4 but will not ship this year?
Answer: The customer readiness issue is that the system did not meet the customer's expectations for performance."
Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: This leaves our system output plan at 12 new systems and our shipment plan at 13 considering the one additional system that missed delivery for material availability reasons in Q4 2016.
We expect our Q1 service and field options revenue to again come in above EUR650 million driven by continued demand for Holistic Lithography options, high value upgrades, and our growing install base. For now we will report HMI revenues under field options and services. Gross margin for Q1 is again expected to be around 47% including the effect from the purchase price allocation for the HMI acquisition. The negative impact of this purchase price allocation adjustment for Q1 is more than 1 percentage point. The impact for the full year is about EUR90 million and will reduce to about EUR40 million per year from 2018 onwards.",".

Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: R&D expenses for Q1 will be about EUR320 million and SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR95 million.
The uptick in R&D spend is driven by the inclusion of HMI and accelerated investments in pattern fidelity metrology our contributions to SMT's High NA developments, our own High NA development acceleration, and the strong US dollar. As a reminder regarding our share buyback program. Last year we purchased EUR400 million worth of our own shares before the program was paused during our acquisition of HMI. It remains paused for the time being as we close our planned investment in Zeiss SMT. The transaction is in the regulatory approval process in the required jurisdictions. We've already received the approval in South Korea and expect the approval from Germany and China in time to close the transaction in Q2 2017.",".

                                                   Thank you, Wolfgang. 2016 was indeed a remarkable year for ASML not only financially as highlighted by Wolfgang, but strategically and product technology wise as we continue to prepare ourselves for continued growth in the coming decade and beyond. I'd like to take a moment to highlight some of these key events. Firstly, our acquisition of HMI will enable us to move from simple imaging and imaging placement significantly in the direction of full pattern fidelity control, which is a key requirement and value provider for our customers at 7 nanometer and below.",".

Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: This along with an expansion of our current products into broader types of applications allows us to lay the foundation for future growth in our Holistic Lithography products group.
Secondly, we brought a key supplier partnership to the next level by agreeing to acquire a minority stake of Carl Zeiss, our major critical optics supplier, for the purpose of not only securing the extension of EUV imaging technology, but also strengthening the current combined businesses of the two companies to improve cooperation and governance. The co-investment of about EUR760 million over a six year period centers on the R&D investments of next generation lenses and related capital expenditure also referred to as High NA, which is critical in meeting our customers' imaging roadmaps throughout the next decade. Lastly and probably more significantly, the industry has turned the corner on EUV.","

What is the significance of the acquisition of a minority stake of Carl Zeiss?"
Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Throughout the year we continued to execute on mutually agreed performance milestones, which allowed our customers to grow confidence in the technology and tool performance.
This resulted in customer decisions to allocate their most critical layers of the next generation nodes to EUV beginning with the industry 7 nanometer logic node. With customers backing this confidence up with orders, we ended the year with an EUV backlog of 18 systems as mentioned. Together with the anticipated Q1 orders, this will cover our 2017 and early 2018 EUV output. As mentioned before, our output capability for 2018 will be around 24 systems. Based on the timing of high volume manufacturing introduction of the advanced logic and memory nodes as announced by our customers, it is realistic to assume that this production capability will be fully utilized by our customers.",".

                                                   Weston Twigg, Pacific Crest. So, my question is related to the memory strength. You mentioned that it should stay strong through 2017 particularly on the DRAM side with bit growth and I was just wondering if you're seeing new DRAM capacity being installed given the pricing trends or if these are tools that are being shipped in the end and then replaced in the DRAM fabs?

Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So, we've seen significant relocations from DRAM capacity into NAND throughout 2016 or starting in 2015 and is really feeling it all back up. Like we said in the previous call, we saw quite a significant capacity drop in 2016 in terms of wafer starts per month in DRAM, which is a double-digit drop and that's being filled up with new DRAM capacity.

                                                   Okay. And then I guess as my follow-up, those upgrades on the NAND side, are those being upgrades that are contributing to your field and service options or is that a different revenue line or are those even being upgraded?

So, I think I heard you say it's realistic to expect 24 tools. What would be the sort of puts and takes on kind of whether you would ship capacity or maybe potentially slightly less in terms of adoption and capacity? And the second question was on the Chinese CapEx and I think you said something on the video on your website. Some of the data points that has been making the rounds of the press suggests that there could be tens of billions of dollars spend on new memory fabs in China.",".

Peter Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - President & CEO    [8]
                                                   On 2018 the determining factor is not so much our capability or the performance of the tool, it is really as you can understand the next nodes of our customers have complexities in there that are not only driven by our capability or our lithography capability. This is really based on the introduction timing of our customers.",".

What is the determining factor for when you will have more visibility on your projects?"
Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So when all our major customers make public statements about when they want to introduce their next nodes and start using EUV, we take those statements and actually we don't only take the public statements to be honest, we have very detailed discussions with those customers on those public statements and what that means.
So, we get very detailed plans of when they need what tool when and that is really driving the let's say realistic assumption that when we have 24 units to sell, we will sell 24 units when they stick to their plans. So this is basically what it is, there's nothing more to it than that.",".

Q: When do you anticipate selling your 24 units?
A: We anticipate selling our 24 units when they stick to their plans."
Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So, customers will decide and it could be that if one customer says I for whatever reason need to do an introduction six months or later, there will be a six month rescheduling. That's what really drives the business. China CapEx, it's interesting. We also have a lot of interest following every comment that comes out of China, all the tens of billions that will be invested in all kinds of fabs all over the place. But you also have to look at what impact that will have on our short-term business.
Now short term yes, there are many ceremonies of fab openings or fab extensions I would say, the number of real new fabs is limited or let's say Chinese owned companies.",".

What impact will the billions of dollars in investment in fabs around the world have on ASML's short-term business?"
Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Of course there are the foreign companies that open fabs in China, but I think the reference to the tens of billions are really Chinese owned companies. Definitely I promise when we look at the next 12 to 18 months, it is good. There's some good logic opportunity, there's some memory opportunity there; but it's all within the realms of good business and not the extraordinary growth that some people are portraying. That will very likely happen, but it's very likely also going to take a bit more time than the 2017/2018 timeframe.

What is the order intake for ASML Holding NV?"
Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: In the fourth quarter you took orders for six EUV tools and at the same time we have some expectation that you will sign volume purchase agreements with some of your large customers for these EUV tools. So, is it now that you will be taking these EUV orders as a normal part of the business as you seem to have done in the fourth quarter or are we to still expect volume purchase agreements in the next few months? And I have one quick follow-up question on the 2018 shipments. 
                                        
Peter Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - President & CEO    [11]
                                                   On the order intake in Q4, that was based on a volume purchase agreement for you could say the 3400 delivery. It does not include yet the additional options that they need on those 3400.",".

What was the volume purchase agreement for the 3400 EUV tools?"
Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So you could say if there's a fully signed and closed volume purchase agreement with that customer not entirely because the options are still under discussion, what they need and the economics of it. But yes, those orders were indeed taken under the agreements that we have on the pricing and the pricing models. That's just for one customer. Other customers will follow suit as we continue in 2017. And for those who will introduce EUV later, those VPAs will be also signed later on in 2018. So as you said, it's the normal course of business.

                                                   And then following on to 2018 shipments, you're going to have this capacity for 24 tools potentially and then you've already got six of those orders at this point.",".

What is the total number of tools that ASML Holding NV will ship in 2018?

The total number of tools that ASML Holding NV will ship in 2018 is 24."
Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: By which point do you need to get all your orders so that that capacity will be readied for the customer? Because you've said in the past that you take almost a year to ship these tools and then there is a time which the customer takes to install the tool in their own facility and get it stabilized. 
                                        
Peter Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - President & CEO    [13]
                                                   The time to ship and install is about a year so it's not plus, plus. So, it's not for us a time of the year to ship the tool. Our time is we can ship an EUV tool so we can install an EUV tool in about three to four months and we have currently an interval or a cycle time in the factory of about six months.",".

What is the time to ship and install an EUV tool?
The time to ship and install an EUV tool is about a year."
Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So all-in-all for us it takes about nine months from start of the tool to get it installed at the customer side. Now then the customer needs to of course start to qualify the production. The issue is in their supply chain and in their supply chain we need lenses, we need large mechanical modules that need to be produced, and this is limiting our output capability right now.
However, having said that to your earlier questions, we are in very intense and deep discussions with customers on volume purchase agreements and it is also clear that those customers need those tools at a certain moment, day, and time. And taking into account our cycle time reduction plans, it is not absolutely necessary throughout 2017 that we need to keep on to this two year timeline.",".

Q: What is the average cycle time reduction plan?
A: We have a plan to reduce cycle time by 50% by the end of 2017."
Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: That will go down, that will be shorter because we will reduce the cycle time as volumes go up. However, to be able to ship 24 units in 2018, those systems need to be booked by the end of the year so in this year. Now if you're going to ask me when should those orders come in; is it Q1, is it Q2, or really Q3; I don't know yet and it's not that important. But what I do know is that if we need to ship 24 units in 2017, those orders need to be in.

The starting point is a gross margin if you take everything into consideration of about minus 75% in 2016. Our objective is to get this business breakeven from a gross margin perspective in 2017 and then in 2018 you would make another significant step forward we are thinking somewhere in the 20%s or so.",".

Question: What is the gross margin target for EUV through calendar 2017?
Answer: The gross margin target for EUV through calendar 2017 is to get the business breakeven from a gross margin perspective."
Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Of course there are a few things that contribute to that and you're right, some of the catch-up revenue that essentially comes at no or low cost will help. But it also will help that this year we are shipping the 3400, which has a list price that's about EUR20 million higher than that the 3350s. We're also going to continue to make progress on the cost side.
We still have significant amounts of field upgrades that we have to do for no charges. We have learning to do, we are making progress on that front as well. And if you then take into consideration also the service business where as you know, we are charging per wafer out; but we got to mind a growing installed base that is not productive in churning out a lot of wafers.",".

Question: What is the list price of the 3400 compared to the 3350?
Answer: The list price of the 3400 is about EUR20 million higher than the 3350."
Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So, we are still spending a significant amount of money on this without revenue coming in. But if you take it all into consideration, we are targeting around breakeven. As it relates to the total business, we were about 45% gross margin in 2016.
I think we are going to continue to make progress in both businesses EUV going from minus 75% to about breakeven, but also the non-EUV business because the mix is shifting towards applications and more higher value systems will make progress as well. But overall I think for your modeling purposes, you should assume that the total Company gross margin will somewhat go down because you're growing the revenue significantly on the EUV line.",".

                                                   Just as a quick follow-up there, are you thinking closer to like 43%, 44%? And then as my follow-up on the foundry side, orders ex-EUV came in fairly weak I think sub EUR300 million in the December quarter. How should we think about the timing of a pickup there? Is that simply turns where they will place the order upon your shipment and therefore really not an issue and how do we think about the trajectory as we contemplate 10 nanometer and 7 nanometer RAM?

Related to orders, first of all we are thrilled to be at an overall backlog of EUR4 billion. Having said that, same story as in prior calls. We published the backlog because it gives you a decent structural view on what's happening in the business; you see memory picking up, you see a lot of EUV orders coming in.",".

First of all, the reason why we put those metrics in there is one, to be able to communicate to you; but also to our customers what we believed at that time when we created those metrics the most relevant milestones were that customers used to get convinced that EUV was going to be the choice of their next generation leading edge litho production.",".

Now just for your information, we are over 200 wattsorders which will actually provide us way more than 1,500 wafers per day and that's what we've shown the customers. That's all.
It is about the confidence that we will be at high volume production requirements by the time that customers need it and that's what's shown with those targets.

This is where we are and this is why we're absolutely confident that we're going to get there and that's why it is the last time we are going to give you these targeted numbers because those milestones have been met evidenced by their customer orders.

Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: That actually brings us to those targets that customers need for high volume introduction, 90% plus availability and productivity at spec. On the ecosystem I think two things, resist and pellicles. Resist, good progress and we get progress reports every now and then and over the last couple of weeks we got some good progress reports of photoresist and on photoresist sensitivity, on linage roughness data and information that give customers good confidence that by end of 2018, 2019 we're going to get what we want. On the pellicle, we have started to outsource the pellicle production to a supplier that actually should make the pellicles for the industry for our customers.
Initially there was a process that yielded low because pellicles still had some defects on it on the pellicle itself.",".

Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: As you can imagine if a pellicle is a membrane sitting in front of the photomask, you don't want any a defects on that pellicle because they're big, they will actually print. Now by the end of the year we actually received the first defect free pellicle and also there we were seeing progress that everybody is looking for. It is not our main concern. What our concern is yes, the supply base of those pellicles will be maturing also so we get a constant flow of defect free pellicles. But if you look at the progress that we have made in the last six months, that gives us the confidence that also by the time when we need the [H] volume, the HVM requirements, we will be there.",".

But just so that I understand correctly there are all incremental improvements really around lifetime extensions, but there is no radical improvement that you need to do, all of that is behind us in 2016. That would not be a correct statement to make technically.

                                                   On the memory, presumably yes, with only 1980s; we always ship if you add some extra capacity some KrF. But going back to an earlier question, this is really backing up the installed capacity that was relocated to NAND, which were basically immersion systems where they were upgraded in the NAND space. So it's predominantly NXTs, but we always have some level of capacity space that is in the existing fabs which also need some KrF, but it's largely NXTs. The level of conversion from 10 nanometer to 7 nanometer. There's always a level of conversion from 10 nanometer to 7 nanometer, which would include upgrades.",".

Answer: The conversion rate from 10 nanometer to 7 nanometer is always present."
Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So the level of commonality from a platform point of view is always there, but it's really the performance on overlay and focus that drives really upgrades.
So when there is a reuse of an existing body in the 10 nanometer space or a previous node on to the new node, then you see upgrade business. And this is a part of the business that we see growing in 2017 where we indeed see the number of upgrades in the logic space, but also in the memory space from let's say previous platforms to the newest specification of the NXT platform really happening and that is part of the business growth that we see in the services and options.

                                                   Farhan Ahmad, Credit Suisse. I have a question related to EUV. What are some of the risk factors that you see going forward? Is there anything that you have to deliver for EUV to be adopted or should we take these orders as a sign that EUV is now at a point that we can count on its delivery in 2018? And also can you remind us again on what the lead time is for EUV going forward?

Question: What are some of the risk factors that you see going forward?
Answer: There are a number of risk factors that we see going forward, but one of the key risk factors is the ability to deliver on our EUV roadmap. If we are not able to deliver on our EUV roadmap, then that could have a negative impact on our business. We also need to make sure that we are able to maintain our market share and continue to grow our business."

                                                   I think ultimately the proof of the pudding is when the customers give you an unconditional commitment to pay you a lot of money, which I think has happened. I think that decision, which most customers have been public about EUV, when they want to use it and how they want to use it, is following this up by orders. So, I think it is true. Somebody asked a question earlier is that what could happen to make 2018 a year where you're not going to fully ship your production capacity.",".

Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: I just answered one of the things is customer roadmaps might change, but what they're telling us today and we know the number of layers that they want to use EUV on that we have to use that capacity and only if a customer changes their minds that things will change, but that's not the case today. On lead time like I said, lead time 2016 was just (inaudible). We had a supply chain that we have to kick out of hibernation. They're now awake I can assure you so lead times will also compress somewhat also throughout 2017. I'd love to have a lead time by the end of the year of about 18 months.","

                                                   And can you talk about how do you see the linearity of 2017? Some of your peers have indicated like there is a stronger first half relative to second half, is that something you see also? And related to the China 500,000 wafer starts, is any of it hitting this year or next year? 
                                        
Peter Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - President & CEO    [43]
                                                   So on the linearity, it's too early to say. Generally we have lead times of about six months for our tools so customers probably gave us a very clear indication of the next six months, which looks very good. The rest of the year is a bit driven by expectations and so that's always a bit more uncertain to a certain extent.",".

Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So, that might be the reason why some of our peers focus more on the first half. It's just visibility. On China 500,000 wafer starts next year, we don't see 500,000 wafer starts next year, it's too much. It will be there, but as I said earlier it's going to take a bit of time. With some of our customers, we've been talking about building new fabs now for two-and-a-half years. In that same timeframe, our logic customers built the fab and we're shipping tools while we're still talking about the others. So, this just has to kick into a different gear also because 500,000 wafer starts next year is absolutely not what we expect good business.",".

First Peter, if you look at your immersion revenue systems, it has been pretty much stable through the last three years and in fact has trended up.

                                                   The next 12 to 24 months I do believe that when you look at what is driving our customers business is this 10 nanometer logic and it's memory, that still needs those immersion systems. So, I think next 12 to 18 months I don't think you will see a lot of change. Although longer term when complexity of chip design increases, the number of layers will also go up.",.

Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Now the increase of the incremental layers are very much the critical ones, which is going to be EUV and as EUV progresses in terms of maturity and productivity, also EUV will grow into the realm of leading edge Deep UV.
But how you look at it, there's also I think clearly discussed at our Capital Markets Day, immersion and Deep UV will be with us forever and also means over the next 10 years or so it's going to be a very significant part of our business, for the next 12 to 18 months is going to be the majority part and the key part of our business given the fact that those nodes that they are being designed into are the nodes that we're currently using and ramping which is not an EUV node.",".

Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Just the statement around significant revenue from EUV for the first time. If I go back to the Capital Markets Day in late October, you seemed to be indicating at that point something on the order of sort of below EUR1 billion mark as a combination of rev rec at shipment as well as the deferred revenue coming through. Is that still a reasonable assumption given better visibility in how you see EUV trending for this year? And also within services and options for this year now that HMI is closed and you're in the integration process, what are your expectations for that business over the next couple of quarters?

Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We said we can ship a maximum of 13 tools, which is a 12 plus 1 carryover.

So without tying it down too much, but I think the number will have a [1] in for sure and some of [1.2] is clearly within the realm of possibilities. Service and field options will continue to grow even if you start with excluding HMI, we grew 7%, 8% this year.",".

And then we have HMI, which are going in for like two months last year and we are not intending to break this out in the future. But you know from the standalone reporting that this should be somewhere in the EUR200 million zip code that is incremental. I think you will see us announcing new products during the year, but they will not lead to any significant revenue in the year. So EUV, field options and services, and HMI are all growth drivers and then you have the rest of the business that is stable and in some cases up a little bit.",".

                                                   On the 3400, there's no major source upgrades just cranking up the power and so that is not necessary the source is the source and we'll be capable of doing 250 watts or at least it's going to be above 205 watts whereas 250 watts doesn't really matter because 205 watts worth 125 wafers per hour and that's the throughput specification. But 250 watts by the way is also not with this particular source design is not our end target. I think with this particular design, we can go higher, we can go 300 watts and above. On HMI, below expectations.

                                                   There is no significant difference in what we have seen already during our due diligence time and since this is a growing business, more importantly the roadmap going forward is well aligned not only within us and HMI more importantly also with the technology folks at the customers. So, we're looking forward to a significant opportunity like we said at our October call which could be up to a EUR1 billion by 2020.

Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: What we're really looking at is you may remember the presentation that we had at the time of the acquisition that the area where we believe we will have a significant growth opportunity is the combination of the holistic lithography or the computational lithography competencies of ASML with the HMI capabilities creating a new product. That is where we think there is going to be a big market and a big growth opportunity and that's not for 2017, it will be 2018 onwards.

Turning to the balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments came in at EUR 2.51 billion. As a reminder, in Q2, we had several extraordinary cash outflows, which have brought the overall cash balance back to our target level. We've paid a dividend of EUR 1.20 per ordinary share or approximately EUR 517 million in total to our shareholders. We also have repaid a maturing bond with an outstanding balance of EUR 238 million.",".

Moving on to the order book. Q2 system bookings came in at EUR 2.37 billion, including orders for 8 3400 EUV systems from 2 customers. Six of the EUV orders came from one customer for use in both logic and DRAM. Total bookings were almost EUR 500 million higher than in the previous quarter. Breakdown of the bookings of 60% logic and 40% memory is the same as in the previous quarter. Strong bookings in the logic sector are in support of the 10-nanometer ramps and in support of the EUV insertion at the 7-nanometer node.",".

Question: What was the customer that placed six of the EUV orders?
Answer: The customer that placed six of the EUV orders was Samsung."
Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Memory bookings, mainly in DUVs, strengthened further from its strong Q1 level, supporting an expected 50% year-on-year revenue growth in the memory sector in 2017.

We expect our positive momentum to continue throughout the year based on the market environment and the related strong demand for our products. We should deliver another record year with net sales growth expected at about 25%, representing one of the strongest gains in annual revenues in our history. 
While Wolfgang reviewed our current quarter performance and outlook for the coming quarter, I would like to provide some commentary on the longer-term outlook of our market drivers, followed by an update on the progress and plans for our product groups. Let me start by making some comments on the market drivers and the impact on litho demand.",".

1. What is the market environment like? 
2. What are the plans for product groups?"
Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: As we have moved further into the year, the demand for memory has continued to strengthen, especially noticeable in DRAM. We are on track to see our memory revenue grow by around 50% year-on-year, creating the highest memory demand in history of ASML. However, we need to remember that this growth in spend coming off 1.5 years of wafer capacity reduction due to significant underspend in 2016 and relocations of leading-edge tools to 3D NAND and that combined with a significant end market demand growth this year. In 3D NAND, the industry continues to witness a number of greenfield fabs that are ramping, which is driving very strong lithography growth.",".

Question: What is the end market demand growth this year?

Answer: The end market demand growth this year is significant."
Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Logic demand, where our tools is expected to grow around 15% year-on-year, driven by the continued ramp of 10 nanometer as well as the start of the 7-nanometer node, which is particularly driving the logic growth this year as it concentrates on the planned EUV adoption. 
With regards to China, we've been doing business in this region for over 25 years and currently have over 600 employees in 11 cities supporting an installed base of more than 400 lithography systems. We also have 2 R&D centers in China and are working to deepen our relationship with Chinese semiconductor industry customers by collaborating with industry consortia.",".

Question: What is ASML Holding NV's outlook for logic demand in 2017?
Answer: ASML Holding NV expects logic demand to grow around 15% year-on-year this year, driven by the continued ramp of 10 nanometer as well as the start of the 7-nanometer node, which is particularly driving the logic growth this year as it concentrates on the planned EUV adoption."
Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We signed a memorandum of understanding with the Shanghai Integrated Circuit Research and Development Center, ICRD, a public research consortium dedicated to the advancements of the semiconductor industry in China, set up a jointly owned world-class application and training center in Shanghai. We have seen continued revenue growth for China   from China over the last 5 years by both domestic Chinese as well as nondomestic companies, and we see a lot of opportunity for growth in this region going forward. However, as we mentioned on earlier occasions, the speed with which this growth will translate into sales and earnings is dependent on the ability of our new Chinese semiconductor customers, who effectively bring qualified and competitive products in volume to the market. This might take some time.",".

Question: What is the memorandum of understanding with ICRD?

Answer: The memorandum of understanding is a formal agreement between ASML and ICRD. It establishes a joint ownership of a world-class application and training center in Shanghai."
Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We are currently in discussions with 5 domestic logic and memory customers, which per published fab plans, that translates into a lithography opportunity of more than EUR 3 billion. This opportunity led last quarter to bookings from a new Chinese domestic memory customer with shipments later this year. 
In summary, we will see significant growth in memory demand versus prior year, and logic will build further on the healthy demand level seen in 2016, largely driven by EUV and China providing a meaningful medium-term growth opportunity. Installed base revenue continues to grow at an even greater rate than last year, driven by broad-based adoption of high-value field options and upgrades. And finally, demand will be further accelerated with the EUV adoption as customers start ramping this technology and volume production.",".

Question: What is the total lithography opportunity for ASML Holding NV?
Answer: ASML Holding NV estimates that there is a potential lithography opportunity of more than EUR 3 billion."
Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Our current view is that the positive business trends that we're seeing in 2017 are likely to continue as we enter 2018. 
On the ASML product side, let me start with an update on our EUV business. In EUV, we continue to make progress as planned. We now have demonstrated all key performance specifications on our NXE:3400 system, and this includes a throughput of 125 wafers per hour. We also demonstrated 250 watts of a source power, enabling productivity improvements beyond 125 wafers per hour. Availability continues to make progress towards the 90%-plus target with continued focus on reducing the variability.

                                                   Okay. I don't think we currently have any reason to change our base case assumptions. We put that in there because the additional 5 or 6 layers that you have identified on top of the 10 that has been communicated earlier, are really layers that, in the discussion with the customers, we have identified as potential additional layers.",".

Answer: We don't currently have any reason to change our base case assumptions."
Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Now that really depends on the speed with which we will be able to mature our EUV systems and drive the productivity up and the availability.

But this year, it's 20% [up]. Within that, you have approximately half service and half options. The service piece is pretty stable with an upward trend. It's a function of the installed base to the last degree. The upgrades are a little bit more volatile, and that has largely to do with when our customers can afford to take the upgrade. Because you've got to remember, some of these upgrades take their machines down for 5 weeks or so.","

Question: What is the company's outlook for the service and options businesses?

Answer: The company's outlook for the service and options businesses is positive, as they are stable with an upward trend due to the installed base."

And that is why, in the second half, the options piece is coming down a little bit. But having said that, we're having a fantastic yield there, 20% up year-over-year. And I think the trends are of continuous growth there will all go into next year.

                                                   well, I think the most important factor that drives the confidence of the customer is actually in the key forms requirements that they need. It's in 250 watts, which we show, the 125 wafers per hour. And of course, we make gradual progress in the availability and in the maturity of that system.",".

So they know that will take some time, just like the development of the ecosystem for them with photomask and with photoresist, will take some time also. But the most important part of that, actually drove that conference calls down to meeting all the key lithographic performance criteria, that drove the conference. We now have a system that actually has all that performance in it. We just have to make it a bit more reliable, and that will take a bit of time. And we will know it, and there's a whole program driving it. And it's as simple as that.",".

                                                   Very helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, in terms of your commentary around memory, in particular, DRAM, can you specify how much of that strength you're seeing across-the-board on shrinks versus 2D NAND upgrades over to DRAM?                                         
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, CEO and President    [10]
                                                   Difficult question to answer. I'm not going to guess in this particular case. But what we are seeing is both a combination of filling up available spots, open spots in current DRAM fabs because of the market demand, and the technology transitions that are happening across the customer base. And some customers are leading in that sense, and other customers are followers.",".

Q: What percentage of ASML's total revenue comes from DRAM sales?
A: ASML's total revenue in Q2 2017 was €2,811 million. Of this amount, €1,811 million came from DRAM sales."
Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: But all do technology migration. It's across the base. So it's a mix, whereby open spots in, you can say, open pedestals in effect to these are currently being filled because of the strong end market demand in DRAM, which is particularly driven by the data centers. So it's a combination of both. With DRAM, that's strong. There are not that many 3D NAND relocations happening. But that happened in the past. That happened over the last 18 months, which created this space to backfill with leading-edge lithography systems to address the rising demand in DRAM market.

Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: I was just wondering if we could revisit to the 2020 model, particularly in light of the strength you're now seeing in 2017 and your expectation heading into next year as well. If I go back to the scenarios, you guys outlined at the Capital Markets Day last year, you gave us sort of 4 scenarios that supported the EUR 10 billion revenue pre-HMI. But given what we're seeing, some of the lower sort of end scenarios that you have there, in particularly unlikely, I mean, first of all, you have talked about the sort of layer count   initial layer count expectations of EUV. You're now seeing sort of 10 layers. At the time, we were still between 6 and 10. So 6 layers quite a bit lower at the low end of that range.",".

What is the likelihood of ASML achieving 10 layers of EUV lithography by 2020?

The likelihood of ASML achieving 10 layers of EUV lithography by 2020 is very likely."
Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And then similarly, in terms of the end market assumptions you are using for your lower-demand scenario, a 20% node-on-node decline in wafer starts seems particularly cautious at this point, given what we're hearing in terms of new compute applications and the greenfield build-outs you've highlighted in China. So given that, I mean, do you not think it's sort of more fair to look at the 2 higher-end scenarios that you've outlined there we should sort of minimize likelihood of the 2 weaker ones?

Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: I mean, we will not be standing there in New York last year telling you exactly where to pinpoint the revenue in 2020. We gave you a bit of a model with the key sensitivities and, as we've explained, the 2 major ones when we go through all of our sensitivities end market demand. And there, we have shown a little bit of sensitivity, and you see, there's not been that much of an upside and a downside compared to the intensity of the EUV and insertion, where we've seen between a high insertion and low insertion, it was quite a bit of a difference. I think the market assumptions provided another EUR 1 billion to the upside and then was another EUR 2 billion or so in the EUV insertion.","

Q: What is the key sensitivity for revenue in 2020?

Whatever you hear is pointing that the market is not going to be soft. And then with the recent accomplishments on EUV, if we follow through, which is our intent to   now that we have the specs met, that we get the availability up.

So earlier in the year, you were thinking, if I recall, sort of EUR 1.1 billion, EUR 1.2 billion. Is that still a reasonable number given sort of shipments and tool performance in the field?                                         
Wolfgang U. Nickl,  ASML Holding N.V. - CFO, EVP and Member of the Management Board    [15]
                                                   Yes. It's a good question. I mean, at this point, I would say that it's going to be around EUR 1 billion or so. I mean, it has to do with a whole bunch of things.",".

Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Like you know, since last year, we can recognize majority of revenue with shipments, but there are still a few things that we need to defer. For instance, if   the installation, we have a little bit if we provide a longer warranty. We have to defer a little bit there. And we also got to really look at whether the configuration at the factory test is exactly the same as when we retest the system at the customer's site, which in a time when you're struggling to get all your material together can sometimes   small pieces are different than the final test at the customer.

Next year, we're going to recognize in the same year, plus we then have a catch-up. I mean, we'll have a deferred revenue balance at the end of this year.

Alexander Duval,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst    [17]
                                                   Alex Duval from Goldman Sachs. Just a quick question on HMI. You've talked a bit more about the innovations ASML is driving to combine e-beam with your computational lithography. Wondered if you could give a bit more color on the key technical aspects you're working on, what's the feedback been from customers you've been discussing with and anything else important on the solutions so far.                                         
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, CEO and President    [18]

Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: The development that we're seeing there is that we're executing as planned, as part of the acquisition, on the combination of the ASML lithographic   let's say the Holistic Lithographic computational competence with the e-beam competence that HMI has in the field. Now the combination of those to the first product will be shipped in the second half of this year and will be evaluated by 3 customers. With positive evaluation, we will then start to ship that product in 2018, which will be a single-beam tool, combined with the ASML computational lithography competence. Now that will be an intermediate solution and will be focused on defect inspection, on wafer inspection. That will be   that will follow by a more, let's say, economic solution, which will involve multi beam.",".

Question: What is the first product that will be shipped as a result of the acquisition?

Answer: The first product that will be shipped as a result of the acquisition is the combination of the ASML lithographic and e-beam competence with the HMI competence in the field."
Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Multi beam, which actually has the advantage of being able to inspect the wafer much faster, which will bring the cost of inspection down, will also   the   you could   so array or the service that you can inspect will also go up, which will also   which could have a very positive impact on the customer yields. So that is a product. That's scheduled for the year thereafter, so after next year, whereby it's not only the multi-beam column. Because if you have a capability to move the wafer faster, you also need faster stages. Now lo and behold, there's one company on this planet that's very good at fast stages, and that's ASML. So I think fast-stage technology, combined with good computational lithography, combined with a multi-e-beam solution will get a very powerful solution for wafer inspection going forward.",".

Question: What is ASML's strategy for fast-stage technology?

Answer: ASML's strategy for fast-stage technology is to combine good computational lithography with a multi-e-beam solution."

                                                   Just going back to the EUV revenue recognition. Wolfgang, how should we think or how should we model deferred EUV revenue by year-end '17? And as shipment starts in '18, should we think of revenue recognition on this EUV system happening at an earlier time? Or in other words, would deferred revenue start to go down? And I have a follow-up.                                         
Wolfgang U. Nickl,  ASML Holding N.V. - CFO, EVP and Member of the Management Board    [21]
                                                   Yes, Mehdi, you're right. So for next year, on the shipments, you should clearly think of the revenue in that   in the same period as the shipment.",".

Yes, Mehdi, you're right. So for next year, on the shipments, you should clearly think of the revenue in that same period as the shipment."
Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And then we currently think that we'll have a deferred revenue balance of up to EUR 500 million at the end of this year. So again, next year, you will very likely see our revenue be higher than the number of shipment times the price because all the deferred revenue is coming in next year.                                         
Mehdi Hosseini,  Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [22]
                                                   Great. And then follow-up regarding the DUV business. Your booking for the June quarter was down 4%, excluding the EUV. And in that context, should I assume that DUV shipment in the second half of the year would be slightly down compared to the first half?                                         
Wolfgang U. Nickl,  ASML Holding N.V. - CFO, EVP and Member of the Management Board    [23]

What is the deferred revenue balance at the end of the year?
The deferred revenue balance is EUR 500 million."
Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: I think   I mean, you can do the math if you take what we said with the 25%, and then you take the EUV shipments and within   and installed base revenue a little bit down in the second half. I mean, the end of the story is DUV in the second half is not going to be too different from what it was in the first half. I think we said also on the call that this business was already very, very good last year, and we're up another 15% or so. And I wouldn't put too much weight, albeit it gives you some info on the structure of the backlog. But I wouldn't put too much on the details on the bookings there.",".

Question: What is the total backlog at the end of Q2?

Answer: The total backlog at the end of Q2 was €5.1 billion."
Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And although we get asked a lot about this [party] over next year, but we see trends continuing in 2018. So EUV is also going to be strong next year.                                         
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, CEO and President    [24]
                                                   Yes. And to add to that, I mean, a 4% down quarter-on-quarter, I mean, you know how our quarterly bookings vary. We have only a few customers, and they tend to send those orders in by batches and then shipped. And then 4% single digit, low single-digit percentages, in my mind, are completely meaningless.

What is the company's outlook for next year?"
Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: My first question is on memory shipments that are up 50% year-on-year. Peter, can you just talk about how much of the growth is driven by increase in capital intensity and EUV? And how much of it is really going to drive the demand higher this year. And also, if you could touch on what percentage of bit growth do you expect in NAND, DRAM market this year based on the shipments that you're supporting? That would be all.

                                                   Could you repeat the first question? Because I thought you talked about memory and then growth in capital intensity, but I thought you said EUV.",".

                                                   So 50% growth that you have in memory shipment, there is some EUV component in that as well, I'm imagining. Please correct me.                                         
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, CEO and President    [29]
                                                   Well, I think in   when you think about the growth in capital intensity, where the 50% growth, is really deep UV. I mean, we do take some EUV memory orders, but that is not for capacity additions. Those are really for ramping up and qualifying the product, and the ramp will be at the end of the second half of 2018 going into 2019. So that is not driven by any EUV shipments.",".

Q: What is the ramp for EUV memory orders?
A: The ramp for EUV memory orders will be at the end of the second half of 2018 going into 2019."
Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: It's really deep UV and particularly strong in DRAM. And that is like I said in the prepared remarks also, but I'd like to repeat it. It's not a major surprise, if you think about it. I mean, the DRAM supply and demand curves are   I'm going to talk about the end product, the DRAM device, really driven by the capacity situation and the end demand. And in a situation like we had in 2014 going into 2015, where 2 major fabs in Korea, M14 and L17, came online, started to take as many tools as they could to fill up the fab, you got a big step up in capacity, where, of course, the end demand doesn't follow that step curve.",".

Question: What was the impact of the two new fabs coming online in Korea in 2014 and 2015?

Answer: The two new fabs in Korea in 2014 and 2015 increased the amount of DRAM being produced, which led to an increase in the amount of DRAM being demanded."
Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And so you have a period in which there is a supply and demand imbalance and, at least, a lower DRAM prices, which actually, at that moment in time, memory makers that could also see strong demand in 3D NAND start to relocate capacity out of DRAM into 3D NAND. Now that end demand, driven by strong data center demand, when that goes up, we'll catch up. And that has actually happened the second half of last year, leading to increased DRAM prices. And that is not a surprise then that those empty pedestals, where previously they had litho tools that are now in 3D NAND, are being backfilled with the technology transitions on top of that.",".

Question: So, ASML is saying that they expect the DRAM prices to go back up when the data center demand goes up?

Answer: Yes."
Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And that is creating the strong demand this year, also driven by a strong end market where the data center demand is very strong for leading-edge DRAM. Now what does that mean for bit growth? Well, bit growth, 26% is what market research firms say, now listening to customers that might come up with some different numbers. But trying to predict those numbers is very dangerous. Because last year, we saw market research firms talking about DRAM growth rates, and I'm talking about the end demand growth rates, of lower than 20%, and it ended up north in the high 20s. So difficult to predict. I would suggest we keep looking at the DRAM prices. The DRAM price, it is a commodity, is a reflection of the supply and demand balance.","

So I just wanted to ask you, in terms of the insertion of EUV, how does it affect the opportunity for you, whether it's bidirectional or unidirectional? Is it fair to think that if it's bidirectional, then there would be a lot fewer steps that are needed for (inaudible) edge?

Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: I   we are not big trackers of this metric. We're solely focused on our EUR 11 billion and the potential upsides to that. And the reason why we're not focusing on this too much is twofold. Number one, historically, the customer CapEx has not shown a strong correlation to our own revenue in a given year. But more importantly, it is something that is very difficult to normalize because you got to think about FX, for instance. I mean, 2.5 years ago, the exchange rate was $1.40, and then it went down to $1.10 to euro. And all of a sudden, the litho spend looks lower, but had nothing to do with our business. It's just the different exchange rate.","

What is the reason ASML does not focus on customer capex as a metric?"
Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Secondly, if you heard earlier in the call, we have a very specific strategy to provide upgrades to our customers that we have in field options and services and that they don't necessarily count in the different people's calculation on adding up these numbers. I think from that perspective, we are not looking at it. But we're not worried about our share on the overall spend. We're worried about executing our road maps and getting to our revenue, and it will be whatever share of whatever somebody puts together.

Thank you, Sandeep. Our first question comes from Mr. David Kircher with JPMorgan. David?

Hi, guys. Just wanted to follow up on that question about 2019. I mean, obviously, you've got orders in your books for '18 and '20, but do you have any sense of what customers might be looking to do in 2019? I mean, are they looking to move to 7 nanometers or 8-plus layers?

Peter Wahlstrom

Yes, David, we do have some sense of what our customers might be looking to do in 2019. We have orders in our books for '18 and '20 of the '20 tools that are going to bid in next year. And we're already talking to our customers about 2019."

It's around 30 units, could be a bit more than that, that they need for 2019, which, by the way, could be almost similar to what we're currently looking at where we can ramp in terms of our own capacity.

If there's any bias, I think everybody would say now that we have an upside opportunity. But let's just get this year under our belt. And next year and at the appropriate time, we'll give you a formal update on the model with new sensitivities.

So if I understood correctly, Wolfgang, did you indicate that the deferred revenue for next year would be around EUR 500 million and also the shipments next year with fee revenues being fully recognized?

Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: I think the ramp-up in the supply chain, of course, when we said customers turned the corner, but the order flow is also a good evidence of it and is also has ignited a lot of activity in the supply chain. However, going from a very low level to then ramping it up here and there, it doesn't always go as smooth as we would want. That's why I alluded to a 1- or 2-quarter delay to the capacity ramp to, let's say, 40, 45 units. And that's where we are. And I think it's not so much a matter of money. Money doesn't always help you. It's just a matter of can you get the people on time trained, can you get the materials on time with long lead times.",".

Question: What is the reason for the delay in the capacity ramp?

Now rest assured, we'll do anything to get more out. If the demand is higher, then we'll just put everything that we can. But I'm afraid money alone will not do it.

Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, CEO and President    [57]
                                                   I think that's a good question, interesting question, but it is not the case at all 5 of those customers are all leading edge. And then you have to define what is trailing edge. If you would say in logic, 28 nanometers and below, you qualify as leading edge, then all the logic is leading edge. Now for memory, at 2 DRAM initiatives there, there are definitely   I would call them leading edge if look at the nodes that they are focusing on. And in 3D NAND, it's 3D NAND.",".

What is the definition of trailing edge for ASML?"
Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: What's leading edge? It's a number of layers, yes? And I think that is where they will start on the learning curve and will not be immediately 64 or 72 layers, but it's going to be a learning curve. Now you have to put that into perspective of why China has taken this step. China's taken this step from a very strategic point of view. In the discussion we have had, very clear that the reason why the stepping up is this, let's say, investment in capacity, leading-edge capacity, is because of the dependence that they currently have on non-Chinese companies who provide China with the right technology. And the geopolitical situation is   has not become more stable or more reliable or more trustworthy from their point of view.","

What is the reason for China's increased investment in leading-edge capacity?"
Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So China has decided that leading technology, leading-edge technology should also be local. And that fits perfectly in the 5-year plan. If you read their 5-year plan, that's what they want. So I don't think that the investment money that will be allocated to those companies that are focusing on trailing-edge technology, that's not going to happen.

We haven't even given a revenue guidance for Q4, and I think I'm not going to start with the gross margin guidance. I mean, in general, it's clearer next year. Even if we   I think I've said before, if we defer revenue, in general, it makes it a little bit more difficult to get to the breakeven, but it makes it more simple to get over the 20% next year.

Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: One correction, I think, 250 watts is not going to be 2019. We have 2 in the 250 watts now. We have the modules that will be inserted in our tool shipments by the end of year, which will provide our customers with 250 watts. So we'll be available as of next year, yes, so one. Two, the   as you know, because you've been following the company for a long time, the value of our tool is really driven by the ability of our customers to keep cutting cost, the cost per wafer, and that   the biggest driver there is productivity. So if, going forward, we can improve, for instance, the transmission of the lens, we can improve the transmission of the pellicle, which all takes   currently takes a way bit of light.",".

Question: What is the biggest driver of the value of ASML's tools?

Answer: The biggest driver of the value of ASML's tools is the ability of ASML's customers to keep cutting cost, the cost per wafer."
Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: The   like I said in the prepared remarks, customers are progressing on the sensitivity of the photoresist. These are all things that are actually helping to get more light on the wafer. When you get more light on the wafer, you move the wafer faster. When you move the wafer beyond 125 wafers per hour and you can guarantee that, then the tool provides more value. And that's exactly how we're going to do this, and this is a general concept which customers accept. Now when we give them   instead of 125, 145 wafers per hour, 145, then we'll charge a higher price because we basically split the value of that 20 extra wafers, 50% for the customer, 50% for ASML. So that will also mean a higher sales price for the EUV system.",".

Question: What is the difference between a 145 wafer per hour machine and a 125 wafer per hour machine?

Answer: The 145 wafer per hour machine will generate 50% more value for the customer than the 125 wafer per hour machine."
Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: But that happens after we can guarantee the over 125 wafers per hour performance, which is the function of the things that I just mentioned.

If you're unable to get through onto the call and still have a question, feel free to contact ASML's Investor Relations department, and we'll get back to you as quickly as we can to answer your questions.

Question: What is the company's outlook for the coming quarters?
Answer: We expect revenue growth in the low single digits and Adjusted EBITDA growth in the high single digits."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: I would like to first highlight some of the third quarter financial accomplishments, and then provide our view for the coming quarter. Q3 net sales exceeded our guidance coming in at EUR 2.45 billion, largely due to the revenue recognition of an additional EUV system. Net system sales of EUR 1.82 billion was nicely balanced between foundry, memory and IDM, and was more than EUR 400 million higher than in Q2.
Installed base management revenue for the quarter came in at EUR 628 million, slightly above our expectation. Our gross margin for the quarter came in at 42.9%. Gross margin was diluted by the additional EUV revenue recognized, but compensated by higher-than-expected DUV and Holistic Lithography sales.",".

Question: What was the main driver of the higher net sales in Q3?
Answer: The main driver of the higher net sales in Q3 was the revenue recognition of an additional EUV system."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Overall OpEx came in slightly below guidance, with R&D expenses at EUR 315 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 103 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments came in at EUR 2.68 billion. As highlighted during our July call, we resumed share buybacks in Q3. During the quarter, we purchased EUR 169 million worth of shares. Since January 2016, we have purchased shares of approximately 6 million shares with a value of EUR 569 million against our 2016 and 2017 authorization of EUR 1.5 billion.
Moving to the order book. The 3 system bookings came in at EUR 2.15 billion. The growth in the immerse and KrF order intake is an indication of the strength of our EUV business.",".

What is ASML Holding NV's authorization for share buybacks?
ASML Holding NV's authorization for share buybacks is EUR 1.5 billion."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Last quarter's strong bookings were driven by the memory sector, which represented 77% of orders compared to 40% in Q2. Our EUV backlog now reflects 23 systems valued at EUR 2.6 billion. As for EUV orders, we are working closely with our customers to understand the EUV demand through 2020 and use this as the basis for our shipment planning. Actual order intake is always lumpy, and we do expect to take additional orders in Q4. Our overall system backlog now totals a record EUR 5.69 billion.
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the fourth quarter of 2017. We expect continuing sales trends in Q4, with total net sales of around EUR 2.1 billion.",".

Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, CEO and President    [5]
                                                   Thank you, Wolfgang. As Wolfgang highlighted, our business continues to perform very well, and demand for our products is very strong. Based on our guidance for the upcoming quarter, we expect to deliver another record year with net sales growth of at least 25% over 2016.",".

Question: What is the expected increase in net sales for the upcoming quarter?
Answer: The expected increase in net sales for the upcoming quarter is 25%."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: The positive industry environment across multiple end market segments continues to fuel strong demand for our products as we move into 2018.
While Wolfgang reviewed our current performance and outlook for the coming quarter, I would like to provide some commentary on the longer-term outlook of our market drivers, followed by an update on the progress and plans for our product groups. This year's memory strength will translate into a record memory revenue year for us. This, in combination with our strong memory backlog, seems to serve as a solid foundation for further growth into 2018. As our customers further migrate next year to the sub-20-nanometer DRAM nodes, we benefit from a significantly increasing litho intensity for those nodes, driving litho intensity up over 30%.
Additionally, we do not see significant near-term completion of new DRAM fabs.",".

What is the litho intensity for sub-20nm DRAM nodes?
The litho intensity for sub-20nm DRAM nodes is increasing by 30%."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: This is amidst a healthy mid-20s DRAM bit demand growth scenario, largely driven by demand for performance memory in the service space. All in all, a strong base for our 2018 DRAM business.
In 3D NAND, litho demand is also strong with a number of greenfield fabs ramping. Current greenfield fabs take approximately 10% more litho spend than the previous 2D NAND fabs. As this technology scales vertically, there are challenges in building these very tall stacks. In response on NAND memory, manufacturers are implementing so-called stacks of stacks, where every new stack needs additional litho, driving litho intensity up by another 20%.",".

Question: What are the challenges in building very tall stacks of NAND memory?
Answer: The challenges in building very tall stacks of NAND memory are that each new stack needs additional litho, driving litho intensity up by another 20%."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: But adding the NAND opportunity to the DRAM business outlook for next year, we can see another strong memory year ahead of us.
Logic demand remains solid, driven by the continued ramp of 10-nanometer as well as the start of the 7-nanometer node. Litho intensity continues to increase as we migrate to future nodes, and further strengthens with the adoption of EUV at 7-nanometer. As expensive multiple patterning schemes keep driving up the cost of every new node, EUV provides process simplification, cycle time reductions and yield improvement, ultimately resulting in customer cost benefits, which clearly explains the stated desire to introduce EUV for the next nodes.
With regards to China, we continue to see revenue increase throughout the year, and are on pace to set a new net revenue from this region in 2017.",".

Question: What is the reason for the stated desire to introduce EUV for the next nodes?
Answer: The stated desire to introduce EUV for the next nodes is due to the process simplification, cycle time reductions and yield improvement it provides."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: This trend of increasing sales to the Chinese region will continue in 2018, as we see strong demand from notable customers building out fabs in China, including additional system orders from new domestic Chinese customers. We expect to see a number of new customers starting pilot ramps next year, and are further expanding our customer support footprint in order to meet the future significant demand growth in this region.
As we mentioned last quarter, we estimate the initial lithography opportunity on these new domestic Chinese customers to be around EUR 3 billion over the next 3 years.
On the ASML product side, let me start with an update of our EUV business. In EUV, availability continues to make progress in both average performance as well as reducing variation.",".

Question: What are the estimated initial lithography opportunity on these new domestic Chinese customers?
Answer: The estimated initial lithography opportunity on these new domestic Chinese customers is around EUR 3 billion over the next 3 years."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: In addition to delivering 0 defect pellicles, we also demonstrated the capability of these pellicles to withstand 250 watts of power in support of 125 wafers per hour and beyond targets.
We continue to work closely with our customers to align on their EUV demand plans and the required timing of tool shipments. Supporting our customers' delivery timing requirements depends predominantly on the ramp-up speed of our supply chain, specifically optics. Long lead time for EUV systems, combined with the inherent fluctuations of our customers' ramp plans poses significant planning challenges.","

What is the ramp-up speed of your supply chain?"
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: To address these challenges, we continue to work intensely with our supply chain to bring the lead times for EUV down from 24 to 18 months.
Taking all of the aforementioned into account, we currently have a production plan of 20 EUV systems next year, at least 30 in 2019 and 40-plus in 2020. Also, in support of EUV production implementation, we shipped the first e-beam EUV reticle inspection tool, the eXplore 6000, to a logic foundry customer. This system enables improved defect detection, as optical inspection has resolution challenges on EUV reticles.
In deep UV, we see continued revenue growth across the product lines, driven by immersion and KrF technology. We provided early access to our latest TWINSCAN NXT:2000 immersion system for initial development of the 5-nanometer node.",".

Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: This new system features several hardware innovations that deliver improved imaging and overlay performance in support of aggressive meshed machine overlay to EUV, which is required for future nodes. The very high demand for our immersion systems equals the fastest ramp of our NXT platform industry as we shipped the 100th NXT:1980 system in Q3. Strong demand for our KrF product is across multiple market segments, but primarily driven by 3D NAND.
In Holistic Lithography, we shipped our first jointly developed product less than 1 year after closing of the HMI acquisition. This product, the ePfm5, is a Pattern Fidelity Metrology system that leverages HMI's high-resolution e-beam metrology with ASML's computational lithography technology. This product's high-resolution capability enables a high capture rate of systematic patterning defects, so customers can accelerate the yield learning curves and drive higher production yields.",".

Question: What is the fastest ramp of the NXT platform industry?
Answer: The fastest ramp of the NXT platform industry is in the immersion systems market. ASML shipped the 100th NXT:1980 system in Q3."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: This integrated system enables the first-ever guided metrology, delivering faster, effective throughput to support volume production.
In summary, we have demand growth continuing across our entire product portfolio. And we expect another record year, at least 25% revenue growth, largely driven by continued strength of memory demand, alongside solid logic demand. Although it's too early to fully quantify 2018, our current view is that the positive business trends that we're seeing in 2017 will continue in 2018.

                                                   Just firstly, I think one of the interesting comments you made on the 3D NAND shifting to customer stack, and I'm wondering if you could just help us to understand how broadly you see that happening throughout the customer base in 3D NAND. Is it selectively or are all of your customers moving towards that trend? And then secondly, on EUV, just one quick update as a follow up if you could.",".

David Terence Mulholland: Sure. So, on the 3D NAND shifting to customer stack, we see that happening in a selective way across our customer base. We're seeing it in our enterprise customers, but not in our consumer customers. And on EUV, we continue to make progress and are on track to start volume production in 2019."

When will the EUR 500 million of revenue be recognized into 2018?"
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: The 3D NAND, how broadly do we see that? We see that with a few customers, not with all of them. But what we understand is that customers have similar issues. Now you can always argue, at what level of specs do they encounter those issues? And that might be different from customer to customer. But I think it's our belief, based on the feedback that we get from customers, that ultimately, they will all have to get to some kind of stack-of-stack approach. But it has started. And it has started not with all of them, but with a few customers.

1. What is the percentage of customers that have experienced issues with 3D NAND?
2. What is ASML's belief based on feedback from customers?"
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We will carry a significant deferred revenue balance into next year, which means that our total revenue for next year will be higher than what the 20 shipments that we have planned and, of course, the 4 upgrades that we also still plan to do. So the total revenue will include some of that deferred revenue. And there will be a little bit of revenue deferred of the 20 systems, but the majority will be recognized. Therefore, we continue to say that for next year, you should use a planning assumption of around EUR 2.5 billion for total EUV revenue.","

What is the total revenue for next year?

                                                   And if I may just quickly follow up on the profitability of the deferral, is that still quite dilutive on where you're recognizing for the 3 tools in Q4? And then is it very profitable next year? Or is there less difference in the deferral this time around?                                         
Wolfgang U. Nickl,  ASML Holding N.V. - CFO, Executive VP & Member of the Management Board    [8]
                                                   It's very different by different line items. But for your planning purposes, just assume the same profitability.

Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, CEO and President    [11]
                                                   The answer on the new capacity is a difficult one. Like I said, let me first answer your first question on the sustainability. On DRAM, like as I said in my prepared remarks, there are no significant new fab plants that will take tools in 2018. So next year.",".

What is the company's outlook for 2018?"
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So in other words, in terms of new fab capacity, it will be pretty limited what you will see in terms of wafers out in 2018, which actually means that the bit demand, which is currently around the mid-20s, needs to come from shrink, from innovation, which actually happens. I mean, there's a lot of innovation happening in DRAM. So we got sub 20-nanometer, and then we'll provide those bits. At least that is what the expectation is. And I would support that, I mean, that the innovation drive should be sufficient to deal with the demand, but there would be no relief.
On 3D NAND, a lot of greenfield fabs, and that means that there's a lot of shipments to those greenfield fabs.",".

Question: So in other words, in terms of new fab capacity, it will be pretty limited what you will see in terms of wafers out in 2018, which actually means that the bit demand, which is currently around the mid-20s, needs to come from shrink, from innovation, which actually happens.

And I would support that, I mean, that the innovation drive should be sufficient to deal with the demand, but there would be no relief.

Answer: Yes, that is correct. We do not anticipate any new fab capacity coming online in 2018 that would be able to meet the current bit demand."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Now when we look at the forecasted bit growth on NAND, it is the reason really where the big question is whether that bit growth is going to be able to absorb all that new capacity in 2018.
We don't know yet. I mean, we've   currently, we've been surprised also this year about a bit stronger bit demand growth that we originally anticipated. That's where probably a bit of a question is probably too early to answer.","

What is the bit growth for NAND in 2018?"
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: But all our memory customers, they indicate that, also, on 3D NAND, they see significant bit growth next year from the demand side.
So if anything, if you would want to place a question on sustainability, now start asking our customers on what they believe how much capacity is now added or will be added in 2018 and what they think about the demand situation. And the demand situation, of course, we're further away from that, so it's more difficult for us to give you an answer in that direction. Now what is new capacity? Well, I actually answered. I said new capacities   a lot of new capacity is being added in the 3D NAND space, not a lot of new capacity in the DRAM space.",".

Question: What is the total capacity of 3D NAND that has been or will be produced in 2018?
Answer: The total capacity of 3D NAND that has been or will be produced in 2018 is estimated to be approximately 128 gigabytes."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: But all in all, if we look, like I said in my prepared remarks, what the drivers are, very much the end drivers as customers tell us are the server markets or the markets for the take-up of the new 3D NAND products all looks very healthy. And customers are very upbeat, as also evidenced by the intake in our order book in Q3.

Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: The main bottlenecks, as I mentioned also in my prepared remarks, are the lenses, the optics. The optics are the gating item right now. So we're working very hard with ZEISS to make sure that we can get a bit more output. But as we currently see it, I mean, we've mentioned in all of the numbers, which are up 20 for next year, at least 30 for 2019 and 40-plus for 2020, that is what our current planning is. But we also have started to run programs with our supply chain to shorter   to shorten the lead time and to shorter the cycle time in their factory.

But for EUV memory DRAM, the adoption is currently target   initial adoption is currently targeted at the end of next year.

We have also said that 40% is not the end of the road. If you look at our other businesses, they return more than 40% gross margin. But that would always include the deferred pieces as well. So breakeven this year, 20% in '18, 40% in 2020, and 2019, somewhere in between 20% and 40%.

                                                   That's a good question. That's an interesting question. And in fact, I think what we can say is that the customer demand that we're seeing for 2019 is in excess of that 30. Now we can just add it all up, and then think about 2 years ahead and what customers indicate to us. That is, I would say, decently above that 30 number. And decently means that it's at least 30% from that number.",".

Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: I mean, the one thing that we have been clear on is a good chunk of that is, of course, the newly acquired HMI business. And there, we said that revenue this year will significantly increase, almost double, albeit from a relatively low level of last year. So it will be somewhere in the $220 million, $230 million, somewhere in that range. And then that business will continue to strongly grow next year based also on the eXplore product and the ePfm5 product that Peter had in his introductory remarks. It's a little bit early to put a number in, but it's a significant step-up, all in support of a business that is going to be around EUR 1 billion in 2020.",".

                                                   Yes, Summit Redstone Partners. Two questions, Peter. First, on the   in terms of the Pattern Fidelity Metrology that you provided, how big can the market be? And can you clarify in terms of the adoption between foundry, logic, as well as memory customers? And then I have a brief follow-up.                                         
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, CEO and President    [30]
                                                   Yes.

Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: But as we've seen with all the solutions that ultimately provide customers with more certainty, what happens on the wafer and gives them the ability to make changes, so that it can really manage yield, that also crosses over to the memory products also. We've seen the same with YieldStar, NetStar (inaudible) logic, and it also moves now over into the memory space.
And how big is that market? Well, that's a good question because where actually it is a product for which a market does not exist yet, because it's a product that actually   or the Pattern Fidelity Metrology where you have, where you use the predictive capability to actually manage yield through the scanner is a completely new area.",".

What is the market size for yield management in memory products?

The market size for yield management in memory products is currently undefined."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So we have our ideas of what it can mean, but   and we think it can create   there's a lot of value. If you look at the first PFM, the Pattern Fidelity tool   metrology tool that we're shipping this year, which we're shipping a few, but the first one we did in Q3, I mean, that has a high level of interest with our logic customers.
So how big is that market? It depends on the value that we're going to provide. We have high hopes and expectations, but that needs to be basically worked out together with the customer because that really   you really show the value on the wafer. So that is   that jury is still out, but we have high hopes, and actually because it provides an efficacy forward loop that nobody else does.","

What is Pattern Fidelity?

Just as we sit here towards the end of 2017, I was just wondering if you could start to give us a bit more of a steer on some of the OpEx items in 2018, particularly around R&D. You guys have been pretty consistent this year at about EUR 315 million a quarter.",".

Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Just interested how to   sort of how that might step up, particularly when we consider the contribution to ZEISS next year, and also likewise on capital spending, particularly as you're continuing to fit out for the EUV ramp.
And then finally, just do you have any thoughts on tax? I know that some of the tax proposal by the coalition government in Ireland are not yet finalized, but have you guys looked at how that might impact your ongoing tax rate?

1. What is the growth rate of SG&A?
The growth rate of SG&A is modest."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: But I think that we'll be growing at a much lower rate than the revenue, and we'll stay around that 1 10 rate, probably a little bit up. If you look   and our objective there for 2020 is 4% of revenue.
For R&D, we're going to add up to 1 25 or 1 26 for this year, which is based on our revenue guidance now with the fourth quarter somewhere just shy of 15%. And if you contrast that to 2014, 2015, 2016, it was 18%, 17%, 16%, the spend, respectively. Now we're around 15%. We will spend more in absolute terms next year, exactly for the reasons that you mentioned. High NA, both on our premises, but then also on Zeiss SMT's premises. And then we do continue to invest strongly also in the Holistic Lithography field.",":

What is ASML's objective for 2020 for R&D spending?

ASML's objective for 2020 is to spend 1 25 or 1 26 on R&D, which is based on its revenue guidance now with the fourth quarter somewhere just shy of 15%."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We're actually accelerating investments there.
A bit too early to give a number. It will be up, but I think it will be 14%. So it will be up in absolute terms. It will come down in relative terms towards our target of 13% in 2020.
CapEx, we're not that super CapEx intense ourselves. We spend around EUR 200 million for the first 9 months. I usually don't guide, but assume that we're getting out somewhere between EUR 270 million, EUR 280 million. The last 3 years, we're somewhere between EUR 310 million and EUR 370 million. So this year, we'll be around 3% only of revenue. Our long-term model is 4%.",".

Answer: The long-term model for CapEx is 4%."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And there, you should expect it to come up a little bit over the next 2 or 3 years, but not beyond the 4%, I think, that we have in our 2020 model. And that is, indeed, to prepare the site for high NA prototypes and high NA manufacturing later on.
Tax rate model is 14%. The innovation box, negotiations have been going very well. We're in the documentation phase. So we have a principal agreement. We're in the documentation phase that very well supports our 14% model. As it relates to the outcome of the coalition negotiations here in the Netherlands, they're   and there's no law yet. That's just a proposal.","

What is the tax rate model for ASML Holding NV?
The tax rate model for ASML Holding NV is 14%."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: But if that comes through, the benefit of the innovation box will reduce slightly   without going into the technical details, will reduce slightly, but it's accompanied with a reduction in the corporate tax rate. So both are literally offsetting to each other.
There may be a slight timing difference that the reduction of the benefit comes earlier than the reduction of the corporate tax rate, but I think that will not be a significant impact on the 14% model, Andrew.

                                                   Yes. I've got questions regarding the ecosystem of EUVs. In your opening remark, you talked about the pellicle withstanding a 250-watt EUV beam, which is really good. Hopefully, it doesn't get too dark too quickly.",".

To start with your last one, the actinic inspection tool is not an issue where we are today, and I don't think it's going to be an issue for the 7-nanometer ramp either. I mean, we're going to patent the inspection. So we basically print the photomask, and you inspect the pattern on the repeatable defects. And then you can now weigh this on the photomask.",".

Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And you inspect the photomask with e-beam preferably, and then you can do the correction.
So masks, I think we have all the solutions that we can think of for the 7-nanometer introduction. Photoresist actually makes some good progress, and especially on the sensitivity side. I mean, we're seeing continuous numbers coming back out of the industry and industry participants on sensitivity of the photoresist, which is good, because the more sensitive the photoresist is, the faster you can move the wafer, the higher the throughput.
So pellicles, you just mentioned, pellicles being able to withstand 250 watts of EUV power is very good. So I think from an ecosystem point of view, all those elements are increasingly coming to phase, where you can call them mass production-ready.

But I mean, there haven't been new DRAM fabs built in the last decade with DRAM capacity having internal demand, et cetera. Do you see the 2 actually   for the footprint of the EUV tool, et cetera, that to get the EUV tool into DRAM fabs, that do you need actually new DRAM capacity rebuilt? Or based on what your application is, you know already that these existing fabs can be actually upgraded to EUV once the conversion starts? And how quick do you expect a memory DRAM conversion to happen? And I want a follow-up after that.

Now as a matter   when you said the last decade, no new DRAM fabs, I may remind you that we have in Korea L17 and M14, which were completely new fabs, which actually are very large fabs that actually drove up the available capacity a couple of years ago, 3 or 4 years ago, to quite significant heights, which I think also led to an oversupply of DRAM at that time.

We will walk you through the math on how that profit will show up in our P&L because it wouldn't be accounting if it would be easy, because we'll have to do a lot of adjustments here. First of all, they are IFRS. We have to translate that into U.S. GAAP. Believe it or not, at 24.9%, you need to do like a mini purchase price allocation.

As it relates to the high NA agreement, we will make R&D contributions, and we will make CapEx contributions. The R&D contributions will show up in our R&D line. Again, it gets complicated. Some of it has to go through the equity piece because we're a partial owner as well, but the CapEx piece will be recorded on our assets, PP&E repayments.",".

So right now, you have just R&D in there, a couple of prepayments and the investment. And then starting next quarter, you'll have some of the profits in there as well. And we'll walk you through in more details in January.

                                                   The next question comes from Mr. Adithya Metuku.                                         
Adithya Satyanarayana Metuku,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate    [45]
                                                   It's Bank of America Merrill Lynch. So I have basically a quick question on EUV gross margins in the third quarter.",".

What was the EUV gross margin in the third quarter?"
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Maybe if you could give us some color around that, and if you still expect EUV to be at a breakeven level this year, given you're deferring a lot more revenue   EUV revenues than you were expecting to defer at the end of the last quarter.
And secondly, just as a follow-up, if you could give us some color on what drove these deferrals. Last quarter, I was thinking you'd be doing around EUR 1.1 billion in EUV revenues, and now it looks like it's going to be a bit lower than that.                                         
Wolfgang U. Nickl,  ASML Holding N.V. - CFO, Executive VP & Member of the Management Board    [46]
                                                   Yes. First of all, I'll check if it's still together after the year to breakeven level. And then like we said, 20% next year, 40% in 2020.",".

Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So I think we're still on track to breakeven this year, but obviously the deferral is a bit higher than we had originally anticipated. And then secondly, can you give us a little more color around what drove these deferrals? Last quarter I was thinking you'd be doing around EUR 1.1 billion in EUV revenues, and now it looks like it's going to be a bit lower than that.

Wolfgang U. Nickl,  ASML Holding N.V. - CFO, Executive VP & Member of the Management Board 

Yes, we are still on track to breakeven this year. The deferral is a bit higher than we had initially anticipated, but we think that the benefits of the technology justify the higher investment. Regarding the deferrals, we don't have any specific information to share at this point."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We have always said we will be above EUR 1 billion. I think at the beginning of the year, we said EUR 1.22 billion. It always depends on which customers do you ship to and when do you ship. I mean, admittedly, the 12 shipments this year are back-end-loaded. And from that perspective, a little bit more goes into next year.
Deferrals, in general, I'll address them by multiple different items. I mean, it could be that you have a new component in the system, which you can demonstrate in your factory. But you have to replicate in the customer factory to take full revenue. And that is the main reason why the revenue this year came down. We have made an adjustment to some systems. It's not a performance adjustment.",".

1. What is the main reason for the revenue decline in 2017?
A. The main reason for the revenue decline in 2017 is due to back-loaded shipments from earlier in the year."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: It's a maintainability adjustment, which is good news because it will help us down the road with service profitability, which, if you recall, is a main contributor to get to the 14%. But since it's a new feature, we cannot go straight to what we achieved last year.
Revenue recognition at shipment, we've got to replicate it at what we call SAT, which is the Site Acceptance Test that the customers require. It's a little bit deferred. That's the difference from the beginning of the year. But it's good news. I think the rest we said earlier. We have a deferred balance that we will start netting into the number in 2018.                                         
Adithya Satyanarayana Metuku,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate    [47]
                                                   Very clear. Just a quick clarification on the R&D next year.",".
