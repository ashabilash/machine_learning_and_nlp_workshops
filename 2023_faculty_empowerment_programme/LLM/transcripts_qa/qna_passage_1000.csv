                                                   Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Speaking first is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.

Tim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [3]
                                                   Thanks, Nancy, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us.",". 1. What is the purchase value of services tied to Apple's installed base? 
A. This is a non-GAAP measure, and a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure can be found on our investor relations website at Apple.com/investor. 
B. The purchase value of services tied to Apple's installed base is $137 billion. 
C. The purchase value of services tied to Apple's installed base increased by $24 billion from the prior year. 
D. The purchase value of services tied to Apple's installed base decreased by $13 billion from the prior year."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: Today, we're reporting the results of a very busy and challenging quarter, and we're also announcing an update to our capital return program. 
Revenue for the quarter was $50.6 billion, which was within our guidance range. Despite the pause in our growth, our results reflect excellent execution by our team in the face of ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in much of the world, and difficult year-over-year comparisons. 
We saw continued currency weakness in the vast majority of our international markets. In constant currency, our revenue declined by 9% from last year, 400 basis points less than the reported decline of 13%. For the first half of the fiscal year, our revenue in constant currency was up 1% year-on-year. 
Despite challenges, there were a number of encouraging signs during the quarter.",".

What was the company's revenue in constant currency?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: Our installed base of over 1 billion active devices continued to grow strongly. We added a huge number of Android switchers and new-to-Mac customers, and we generated very strong growth from services. 
We sold 51.2 million iPhones in the quarter, consistent with the range of our own expectations, but lower than the exceptional year-ago quarter, when we saw an acceleration in iPhone upgrades, and 40% iPhone sales growth over the previous year. To provide some additional color, iPhone sales come from three sources: Customers who upgrade from previous iPhone models, customers who switch from Android and other operating systems, and customers who purchase a smart phone for the first time. 
As we look at each of these three sources of iPhone sales, we see a business that is healthy and strong.",".

What was the percentage of iPhone sales from each source?
The answer is that the percent of iPhone sales from each source was: 
-Upgraded from previous iPhone models: 37%
-Switched from Android and other operating systems: 32%
-Purchased for the first time: 17%"
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: First, from an upgrade perspective, during the first half of this year, the upgrade rate for the iPhone 6s cycle has been slightly higher than what we experienced in the iPhone 5s cycle two years ago, but it is lower than the accelerated upgrade rate we saw with iPhone 6, which as you know, was a big contributor to our phenomenal revenue growth a year ago. Most importantly, our customers are incredibly loyal. A recent Kantar survey of US smart phone purchasers indicated a 95% iPhone loyalty rate, the highest ever measured for any smart phone. 
Second, we continued to see a very high level of customers switching to iPhone from Android and other operating systems. In fact, we added more switchers from Android and other platforms in the first half of this year than any other six-month period ever.",".

What is the iPhone loyalty rate?
A 95% iPhone loyalty rate was measured in a Kantar survey of US smart phone purchasers."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: 
And third, with only 42% smart phone penetration of the global handset market today, iPhone is still attracting millions of first-time smart phone buyers each quarter, especially from emerging markets. For example, in India, our iPhone sales were up 56% from a year ago. 
Next, I'd like to talk about services, which was our second-largest revenue generating category during the quarter. Setting aside the amount we received from a patent settlement in the December quarter, the March quarter services revenue was our highest ever. Services revenue jumped 20% to $6 billion. App Store revenue was up 35% to beat last quarter's all-time record, and Apple Music continues to grow in popularity with over 13 million paying subscribers today.",".

Question: What was the highest ever services revenue?
Answer: The March quarter services revenue was our highest ever."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: We feel really great about the early success of Apple's first subscription business, and our Music revenue has now hit an inflection point after many quarters of decline. 
The services business is powered by our huge installed base of active device, which crossed 1 billion units earlier this year. As we discussed on this call in January, those 1 billion-plus active devices are a source of recurring revenue that is growing independent of the unit shipments we report every three months. In fact, the purchase value of services tied to our installed base was a record $9.9 billion in the March quarter, up 27% over last year, accelerating from the 24% growth rate we reported in the December quarter.",".

Question: What was the purchase value of services tied to your installed base in the March quarter?
Answer: The purchase value of services tied to our installed base was a record $9.9 billion in the March quarter."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: 
The reach of Apple Pay also continues to expand, following a very successful launch in China in the March quarter, and last week's roll-out in Singapore. Apple Pay is growing at a tremendous rate, with more than 5 times the transaction volume of a year ago, and 1 million new users per week. There are more than 10 million contactless ready locations in the countries where Apple Pay has launched today, including over 2.5 million locations now accepting Apple Pay in the United States, and more expansion of Apple Pay is coming soon. 
Turning to the Mac, we met our sell-in expectations, in addition to reducing channel inventory by about 100,000 unites. Overall, the Mac continues to attract  a large percentage of new customers.",".

What is the ""transaction volume"" of Apple Pay?
5x"
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: In our latest survey of major markets, over half of buyers were new to the Mac, and in some countries, the percentage is extremely high, like in China, where over 80% of customers were purchasing a Mac for the first time. We're confident in our Mac business, and our ability to continue to innovate and gain share in that area. 
Turning to the Apple Watch, unit sales met our expectations in the quarter. For some color on how we think about Apple Watch sales, we expected seasonality to be similar to the historical seasonality of iPod, which typically generated 40% or more of its annual unit sell-through in the December  quarter. 
We started shipping Apple  Watch just one year ago, and it has quickly become the best-selling and most loved smart watch in the world.",".

What is the expected seasonality for Apple Watch sales?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: In fact, unit sales of Apple Watch during its first year exceeded sales of iPhone in its first year. Last month, we refreshed the lineup for the spring with new bands and a new starting price point, and the response from customers has been great. 
Apple Watch is an increasingly essential part of user's lives, from responding to messages, managing calendars and navigating with maps, to helping them  be more fit. And in some cases, the heart rate sensor has even helped save lives. We're really excited about the first year with Apple Watch. We have learned a lot, and we believe it has an exciting future ahead. 
We announced some fantastic new products during the March quarter.",".

Q: What was the new starting price point for Apple Watch?
A: The new starting price point for Apple Watch is $349."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: iPhone SE became available on March 31, so none of its sales were reflected in our second-quarter results, but so far this quarter, we're seeing terrific customer response. iPhone SE is the most powerful four-inch phone ever, and it's a great option for customers all over the world who want a compact phone with advanced features, and a great price, without compromising performance. Demand has been very strong, and exceeds supply at this point, but we're working hard to get the iPhone SE into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible. The addition of the iPhone SE in the iPhone lineup places us in a better strategic position to attract even more customers into our ecosystem. 
We also unveiled the stunning 9.7 inch iPad Pro, with cutting-edge performance and our most advanced display yet.",".

What is the iPhone SE's main selling point?
The iPhone SE is the most powerful four-inch phone ever, and it's a great option for customers all over the world who want a compact phone with advanced features, and a great price, without compromising performance."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: The reviews of our new iPad Pros have been great, and we are hearing from customers of the features and capabilities in the new Pros make them both the ultimate upgrade for iPad owners, and a great PC replacement. 
In the June quarter, we expect to see our best iPad revenue compare in over two years. iPad is the best-selling, best-reviewed and  most used tablet on the market. Customers tell us that they love iPad for its unique mix of portability, capability, and versatility, with over 1 million iPad apps in the App Store to help them work, play, learn, and create.","

What is the best selling tablet on the market?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: 
We also announced Care Kit, a new software framework that developers can use to help people take a more active role in their health, by keeping track of their care plans, monitoring their symptoms and medication, and delivering the insights they need to make smart decisions about their health. We're very excited about the ways iPhone and Apple Watch are helping people lead healthier lives. We believe there's great promise here for the future, and we are very interested in where this can take us. 
As always, we are contributing to society beyond our products, promoting the use of renewable energy across our facilities and inside our supply chain, and developing cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize recycling in the materials we use.",".

What is the name of the new software framework that was announced?

The name of the new software framework is CareKit."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: We are unwavering in our commitment to protect the security and privacy of our customers and their data, and we are actively promoting inclusion and equality across our business. 
As we continue through the June quarter, I'd like to remind you that we measure the health of customer demand based on sell-through. Despite ending Q2 within our channel inventory targets, in light of the macroeconomic environment we plan to lower our channel inventories in the June quarter. This will impact our reported revenue in Q3. Luca will provide more details on this in his commentary. 
But before turning over the call to him, I will summarize by saying that the future of Apple is very bright. Our product pipeline has amazing innovations in store.",".

1. What is the ""macroeconomic environment""?
2. How will lowering channel inventories impact reported revenue in Q3?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: We are very excited about bringing together developers for our four major platforms at our worldwide developers conference in June. 
We are forging ahead with important investments in research and development, in our infrastructure, and in our supply chain. We've made 15 acquisitions in the last four quarters to accelerate our product and services roadmaps, and we are always on the lookout for companies with great technology, talent, and strategic fit. 
Creating value for shareholders by developing great products and services that enrich people's lives will always be our top priority, and the key factor driving our investments and capital allocation decisions.",".

Question: What acquisitions have been made in the last four quarters?
Answer: In the last four quarters, Apple has acquired 15 companies, including Beats Music, Autodesk, and Aptiv."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: As our business continues to generate high levels of free cash flow, we are in the fortunate position to expand our capital return program again this year, as we have done each year since we started the program four years ago. 
Today, we are announcing an extension of the timeframe of the program by four quarters through March of 2018, and we are expanding the total program size from $200 billion to $250 billion. Luca has more details on this announcement and our results for the March quarter. Luca?                                          
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO    [4]
                                                   Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with the March quarter results. Revenue for the quarter landed within our guidance range at $50.6 billion, compared to $58 billion in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 13%.",". Q: What was the main reason for the revenue decline? A: The main reason for the revenue decline was lower sales of iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: 
As we had expected, our comparisons to last year were influenced by the continued strength of the US dollar against foreign currencies. That being said, in constant currency, our revenue declined by 9%. On a geographic basis, in Asia, our revenue grew strongly in Japan, but it declined in greater China and the rest of Asia-Pacific. 
However our business in these two regions is faring better than the numbers might suggest. We had significant channel inventory reductions and currency weakness, which affected our reported revenue for both of these segments. In mainland China, revenue was down 11%, and the decline was 7% in constant currency terms. Keep in mind that we were up against an extremely difficult year-ago compare, when our mainland China revenue grew 81%.",".

Question: What caused the revenue decline in Asia?
Answer: The revenue decline in Asia was due to weak performance in China and the rest of Asia-Pacific."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: We remain very optimistic about the China market over the long-term, and we are committed to investing there for the long run. 
Gross margin was 39.4%, near the high-end of our guidance range, thanks to strong cost performance. Operating margin was 27.7% of revenue, and net income was $10.5 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.90, and cash flow from operations was strong, at $11.6 billion. 
For details by product, I start with iPhone. We sold 51.2 million iPhones in the quarter, compared to 61.2 million in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 16%. It was a particularly challenging comparison to the record quarter a year ago, when iPhone 6 grew 40% as we entered last March quarter, and supply demand imbalance, which was recovered during the quarter.",".

Question: What was the main reason for the decline in iPhone sales in the quarter?
Answer: The main reason for the decline in iPhone sales in the quarter was a decrease in demand due to a supply demand imbalance."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: 
Also, this year we reduced channel inventory by 450,000 units, while we increased inventory by 1 million units a year ago. We have exited the quarter with in our five to seven-week target range for channel  inventory. iPhone ASV was $642 compared to $659 in the year ago quarter, with weak international currencies and very popular mid-tier and entry offerings contributing to the difference year-over-year. 
iPhone's momentum in business markets continues to be very impressive. A recent survey by 451 Research, formerly known as ChangeWave, found that among US corporate buyers planning to purchase smart phones in the June quarter, 78% planned to purchase iPhones. That's the highest June quarter iPhone purchase intent ever measured by the survey and 5 points higher than a year ago.",".

What is the main reason for the difference in iPhone sales between this year and last year?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: 
Turning to services, we generated $6 billion in revenue, an increase of 20% over the March quarter last year, thanks primarily to the continued strong performance of the App Store, with revenue growing 35% to a new all-time high. According to App Annie, the App Store generated 90% more global revenue than Google Play in the March quarter, up from a 75% lead in 2015. Among our customers who purchased apps and content from our iTunes Stores, the average amount spent per customer reached a new all-time record in the March quarter. 
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4 million Macs compared to 4.6 million last year, a decline of 12%. It was a challenging quarter for personal computer sales across the industry, but we believe we gained market share.",".

What was the total revenue for Apple's services division in the March quarter?
$6 billion"
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: Despite the overall market slowdown, we generated double-digit market growth in a number of markets, including Russia, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and the UAE. 
Just last week, we updated the MacBook, our thinnest and lightest Mac, with the latest processors, faster graphics, fastest flash storage, and longer battery life. We think our customers are going to love this update. We ended the quarter within our four to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory. 
Turning to iPad, we sold 10.3 million compared to 12.6 million in the year ago quarter. We also reduced channel inventory by about 200,000 units, and we exited the quarter within our five to seven-week target range. In the same segments of the public market where we compete, we continue to be highly successful.",".

What was the market growth rate in the mentioned markets?

The market growth rate in the mentioned markets was double digit."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad had 78% share of the US market for tablets priced above $200. And the latest data published by ABC indicates that iPad accounts for 72% of the US commercial tablet market, comprising business, government, and education. 
iPad customer metrics are also extremely positive. In February, 451 Research measured a 97% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2, and among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 59% planned to purchase an iPad, more than 3 times the purchase intention rate of the next highest brand measured. Corporate buyers reported a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad, and a June quarter purchase intent of 71%. 
Revenue from other products grew 30% over the last year, thanks to Apple Watch.",".

What is the percentage of the US tablet market that iPad holds?

Our customers are very happy with Apple Watch, with 451 Research measuring 94% customer satisfaction. 
We're also making great progress with our enterprise initiatives. IBM now has engagements for more than 200 deployments of native iOS apps for large enterprise customers to accelerate mobile transformation. Our mobility partner program also continues to grow, with 108 partners across 20 countries. 
We see continued broad industry adoption of native iOS apps to transform how professionals do their work and serve their customers. For example, retail bankers are using iOS apps on iPads to greet and onboard customers, reduce queue times, and improve the customer experience.",".

What is the percentage of customer satisfaction for Apple Watch?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: And in hospitals, using doctors and nurses are using iOS Apps on iPhone and iPad to share and communicate more effectively, so that they can spend more time with patients, and less time on administrative tasks. 
Let me now turn to our cash positions. We ended the quarter with $232.9 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $17.2 billion. $208.9 billion of this cash, or 90% of the total, was outside the United States. 
We issued $15.5 billion in US dollar denominated notes during the quarter, including our first green bond tranche to fund initiatives such as renewable energy and environmental design projects. We exited the March quarter with $72 billion in term debt.",".

Question: What is the total amount of cash Apple has?
Answer: The total amount of cash Apple has is $232.9 billion."

We have now completed over $163 billion of the current $200 billion capital return program, including $117 billion in share repurchases. As Tim mentioned, today we are announcing the latest update to our program, which we are increasing to a total of $250 billion. Once again, we are allocating the majority of the expansion of the program to share repurchases, given our strong confidence in Apple's future, and the value we see in our stock. The Board has increased the share repurchase authorization by $35 billion, raising it from the current $140 billion level to $175 billion. We will also continue to net share settle, less the employee restricted stock units.",".

Question: What was the total value of dividends and equivalents returned to investors in the quarter?
Answer: The total value of dividends and equivalents returned to investors in the quarter was $2.9 billion."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: 
We also know that the dividend is very important to many of our investors who value income, and we are raising it for the fourth time in less than four years. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.52 per share to $0.57 per share, an increase of about 10%. This is effective with our next dividend, which the Board has declared today is payable on May 12, 2016, to shareholders of record as of May 9, 2016. 
We continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. With $12 billion in annual dividend payments, we are proud to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world. In total, with this updated program, during the next eight quarters, we expect to return $87 billion to our investors, which represents about 15% of our market cap at the current stock price.",".

Question: What is the dividend increase for the fourth time in less than four years?
Answer: The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.52 per share to $0.57 per share, an increase of about 10%."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: 
As in the past, we expect to fund our capital return program with US cash, future US cash flow generation and borrowing from both domestic and international debt markets. We will continue to review capital allocation regularly, and solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This allows us to be thoughtful about the size, the mix, and the face of the program. 
As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $41 billion and $43 billion. The revenue guidance implies a year-over-year decline, as we lap an incredibly strong June quarter last year, when revenue grew 33%, due in part to accelerated iPhone upgrade purchases.",".

Question: What is the expected decline in revenue?
Answer: The expected decline in revenue is due to the fact that last year's strong June quarter was due in part to accelerated iPhone upgrade purchases."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: This tough compare is compounded by the continued weak macro environment this year, and the strong US dollar, which affects our revenue growth in international markets. 
Embedded in this guidance is a planned channel inventory reduction worth  over $2 billion, as we have elected to be prudent about our channel inventory position, given the current macro environment. The guidance also reflects a range of possible scenarios related to how quickly we can get into supply-demand balance for iPhone SE. Due to these factors, our expected demand is greater than the revenue range implies. 
Sequentially, our guidance implies a revenue decline of 15% to 19%, which is comparable to the 17% sequential decline that we've averaged from the March to June quarter for the last three years, despite the anticipated channel inventory adjustments I just described.",".

Question: What is the expected demand for iPhone SE?
Answer: The expected demand for iPhone SE is greater than the revenue range implies."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: We expect seasonal sequential declines in iPhone and iPad sales, and a sequential increase in Mac sales. We also expect iPhone ASPs to decline sequentially as we get further from the launch of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, and as iPhone SE enters the mix. 
We know that our revenue guidance falls short of market estimates for the third quarter. We believe the difference counts primarily from three areas: First, the $2 billion plus channel inventory reduction I just mentioned. Second, the effect of the channel inventory reduction, and the launch of iPhone SE on iPhone ASPs, as well as the current constrained supply of iPhone SE. Third, different estimates for Mac, which we expect to grow sequentially at the rate similar to what we have experienced in the past June quarters.",".

What is the effect of the channel inventory reduction?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: 
We expect gross margins to be between 37.5% and 38%. We expect continued cost improvements to be more than offset by the sequential loss of leverage from lower revenue, and a differing mix of products. We expect OpEx to be between $6 billion and $6.1 billion. 
We expect OI&E to be about $300 million. And we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.

Simona Jankowski,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [2]
                                                   My first question was actually just a clarification, in terms of putting in context that $2 billion in channel inventory reduction.",". 

What was the impact of the $2 billion in channel inventory reduction on gross margin and OpEx?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: What was that last year, just to help us make the comparison on a year-over-year basis? The bigger question, Tim was, with the smart phone market now reaching a pretty mature growth base, how does Apple think of itself going forward? Is it a growth company, or is it a more mature tech company? And if it's still the former, how does that change how you think about M&A especially given the position you're in with your balance sheet strategically?                                          
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO    [3]
                                                   Simona, let me give you the data point on the sell through and then I'll let Tim answer the strategic question. We had a channel inventory reduction that was worth a bit less than $800 million a year ago.

What was that last year, just to help us make the comparison on a year-over-year basis?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: In terms of do I think the smart phone market is mature? I think that the market, as you know, is currently not growing. However, my view of that is that's an overhang of the macroeconomic environment in many different places in the world. We're very optimistic that this too shall pass, and that the market and particularly us will grow again. 
The reason that we're optimistic is we look at sort of the three places that iPhone sales come from, and from an upgrade point of view, as I mentioned in my comments, we compare favorably, slightly better than the upgrade cycle that we saw on the iPhone 5s.","

What is Apple's view of the market's maturity?
Apple believes that the market is currently not growing, but that this will change in the future."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: We are lower than the iPhone 6, but I think all of us know that was an extraordinary cycle, that accelerated upgrades from 2016 into 2015, and so that comparable will be tough for this year, but that's a transitory thing. 
As we look at switchers, we're extremely excited that for the first half we have set a record from switchers from other platforms. The largest we've ever seen in any six month period before, so we've got traction there. And then on emerging markets, if you take a look at India, we grew by 56%, and we're placing increasing emphasis in these areas, where it's clear there will be disproportionate growth versus the more developed areas.",".

Question: What is your outlook for the iPhone 6 cycle?
Answer: We are lower than the iPhone 6, but I think all of us know that was an extraordinary cycle, that accelerated upgrades from 2016 into 2015, and so that comparable will be tough for this year, but that's a transitory thing."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: 
The next thing is with the iPhone SE, we have seen our ability to attract even more customers into the platform, with incredible product that is at a new price point for us, with the latest technology. And so we're optimistic about attracting even more customers with that. We also look at our pipeline, and were very excited about what's in our pipeline. All of those things make me optimistic. 
Your other question was on M&A, and regardless of the first, we're always looking in the market about things that could complement things that we do today, become features in something we to, or allow us to accelerate entry into a category that we are excited about. As I have said before, our test is not on the size. We would definitely buy something larger than we have bought thus far.",".

Question: What is the test for M&A?
Answer: Our test is not on the size."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: It's more about the strategic fit, and whether it's  a great technology and great people. We continue to look, and we stay very active in the M&A market.

What is the company's strategy for M&A?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: Tim, can you talk a little bit about the iPhone ASP trends, and specifically you mentioned that the SE is going to impact, but how are you thinking about the aspirational market share that's out there, and your actual market share, and using price to close that gap? Is it just the SE or could there be other iPhone models that will be discounted, to try to be more aggressive in emerging markets? 
And one for Luca. Can you talk a little bit about the services segment, in terms of what piece of the services is driving growth, and maybe a little bit about the profitability on a net basis versus the growth basis that you  have referred to in the past. Thanks.

1. What are the two types of customers that the SE is attracting? 
2. How do you think about the aspirational market share that's out there? 
3. How do you think about your actual market share? 
4. How do you think about pricing to close the gap between your aspirational market share and your actual market share?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: One is   customers that wanted the latest technology, but wanted it in a more compact package. And we clearly see even more people than we thought in that category. 
Secondly, it's attracting people aspire to own an iPhone, but couldn't quite stretch to the entry price of the iPhone, and we've established a new entry. I think both of these markets are very, very important to us, and we are really excited about where it can take us. I do think that we will be really happy with the new to iPhone customers that we see from here, because of the early returns we've had. We are currently supply constrained, but we'll be able to work our way out of this at some point. But it's great to see the overwhelming demand for it.",".

What is the new entry for iPhone customers?

The new entry for iPhone customers is people aspire to own an iPhone, but couldn't quite stretch to the entry price of the iPhone."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: I will let Luca comment on the ASPs.                                          
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO    [10]
                                                   On the ASPs, Gene we mentioned that we were going to be down sequentially, and this is really the combination of two factors. So when we go from the March quarter to the June quarter, is the fact that we are having the SE entering the mix, and that obviously is going to have a downward pressure on ASP, and also this channel inventory reduction that we have talked about, obviously the channel inventory reduction will come from higher-end models, and that is also affecting the sequential trend on ASPs. 
The question on services, when we look at our services business, obviously growing very well across the board.",".

Q: What is the outlook for services?
A: We continue to see strong growth in services, with revenue growing across all geographies and product categories. We expect this growth to continue in the future."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: The biggest element, and the part of the services business that is growing very well, we mentioned 35%, is the App Store. It's interesting for us that our music business, which had been declining for a number of quarters, now that we have both a download model and a streaming model, we have now hit an inflection point, and we believe that this would be the bottom, and we can start growing from there over time. 
We have many other services businesses that are doing very well, we have an iCloud business that is growing very quickly. Faster than the App Store, from a much lower base but I think it's important for us as we continue to develop these businesses. Tim have talked about Apple Pay.",".

Question: What is the bottom for the music business?
Answer: The bottom for the music business is when it hits an inflection point and starts to grow from there."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: It doesn't provide a meaningful financial contribution at this point, but as we look at the amount of transactions that go into Apple Pay right now, and we think ahead for the long-term, that could be an interesting business for us, as well. 
From a profitability standpoint, we have mentioned last time that when you look at it on a gross basis, so in terms of purchase value of these services, the profitability of the business is similar to Company average. Of course, when you met out the amount that is paid to developers, and you look at it, in terms of what is reported in our P&L, obviously that business has a profitability that is higher than Company average.",".

Answer: The profitability of the business is similar to Company average."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: We don't get into the specifics of specific products or services, but it is very clear it is significantly higher than Company average.

                                                   Yes, thank you. First for Luca. This is the worst gross margin guide in a year and a half or so, and over the last couple of quarters, you have talked about number of tailwinds including component cost, the lower accounting deferrals that went into effect in September. You just mentioned the services margins are above corporate average.",".

Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: So the question is, are some of those tailwinds winding down? Or is a significant guide down in gross margin for the June quarter entirely related to volume and the 5 SE? And then I have a follow-up for Tim.                                          
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO    [15]
                                                   Katy, clearly the commodity environment remains quite favorable, and we continue to expect cost improvements. The other dynamics that you have mentioned are still there, obviously what is different, and particularly as we look at it on a sequential basis coming out of the March quarter, we would have loss of leverage, and that obviously is going to have a negative impact on margins. The other factor that's important to keep in mind is this different mix of products.",".

What is the different mix of products that is impacting margins?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: 
Particularly when you look at iPhone, what I was mentioning to Gene earlier, I think we've got a couple of things that are affecting not only ASPs, but obviously, they also affects margins. And it's the fact that we have a channel inventory reduction at the top end of the range, and we've got the introduction of the iPhone SE at the entry level of the range. And so when you take into account those factors, those are the big elements that drive our guidance range right now.                                          
Katy Huberty,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [16]
                                                   Okay. Thank you. And that a question for Tim, appreciate the optimism around longer-term iPhone unit growth, but with developed market penetration in anywhere from 60% to 80%, the growth is going to have to come from new markets. You talked about India."," for India.

Q: What are your thoughts on the potential for growth in India?
A: We believe that there is significant potential for growth in India, given the country's population and growing middle class. We continue to believe that the iPhone is a strong product in India, and we are excited about the opportunities that the country presents."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: Could you just spend a little bit more time on that market? What are some of the hurdles you have to overcome, for that to be a larger part of the business? When we expect Apple to have more distribution, and specifically your own stores in that country? Thanks.                                          
Tim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [17]
                                                   Katy, in the short term, let me just make a couple of comments on the developed markets, just to make sure this is clear. If you look at our installed base of iPhone today versus two years ago, it's increased by 80%. When you think about upgrade cycles, upgrade cycles would have varying rates on it. As I talked about on the comments, the iPhone 6s rate, upgrade rate is slightly higher than the iPhone 5s, but lower than the iPhone 6.",".

1. What is the iPhone 6s' upgrade rate?
2. How does this compare to the upgrade rates of other iPhone models?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: 
But the other multiplier in that equation is obviously the size of the installed base. The net of the idea is that I think there's still really, really good business in the developed markets, so I wouldn't want to write those off. It's our job to come up with great products that people desire, and also to continue to attract over Android switchers. With our worldwide share there's still quite a bit of room in the developed markets, as well. 
From an India point of view, if you look at India, and each country has a different story a bit, but the things that have held not only us back, perhaps, but some others as well, is that the LTE rollout with India just really begins this year.",".

Question: What is the size of the installed base in the developed markets?
Answer: The size of the installed base in the developed markets is still really, really good."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: So we will begin to see some really good networks coming on in India. That will unleash the power and capability of the iPhone, in a way that an older network, 2.5G or even some 3G networks, would not do. The infrastructure is one key one, and the second one is building the channel out. 
Unlike the US as an example, where the carriers in the US sell the vast majority of phones that are sold in the United States, in India, the carriers in general sell virtually no phones, and it is out in retail, and retail is many, many different small shops. We've been in the process. It's not something we just started in the last few weeks.",".

1. What is one key reason why the iPhone will be able to perform better on Indian networks than older networks?
2. How are Apple plans to generate more sales for the iPhone in India?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: 
We've been working in India now for a couple of years or more, but we've been working with great energy over the last 18 months or so, and I am encouraged by the results that we're beginning to see there, and believe there's a lot, lot more there. It is already the third largest smart phone market in the world, but because the smart phones that are working there are low-end, primarily because of the network and the economics, the market potential has not been as great there. I  view India as where China was maybe 7 to 10 years ago from that point of view. I think there's a really great opportunity there.

What is Apple's view of the potential for the Indian smart phone market?

Toni Sacconaghi,  Bernstein - Analyst    [20]
                                                   I have one, and then a follow-up, as well. My sense is that you talked about adjusting for the changes in channel inventory, that you are guiding for relatively normal sequential growth. And I think if you do the math it's probably the same or perhaps a touch worse in terms of iPhone unit growth sequentially, relative to normal seasonality between fiscal Q2 and Q3.",".

Q1. What guidance did you give for sequential iPhone unit growth in fiscal Q2 versus fiscal Q3?
A. We guided for relatively normal sequential growth in iPhone unit growth between fiscal Q2 and Q3."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: I guess the question is, given that you should be entering new markets and you should see pronounced elasticity from the SE device, why wouldn't we be seeing something that was dramatically above normal seasonal, in terms of iPhone revenues and units for this quarter? 
Maybe you could push back on me, but I can't help thinking that when Apple introduced the iPad Mini in a similar move, to move down market, there was great growth for one quarter, and the iPad never grew again and margins and ASPs went down. It looks like you are introducing the SE, and at least on a sequential basis, you not calling for any uplift, even adjusting for channel inventory, and ASPs I presume will go down and certainly it's impacting gross margins as you've guided to.",".

The channel inventory reduction that Luca referred to, the vast, vast majority of that is in iPhone. That would affect the unit compare that you maybe thinking about. The iPhone SE, we are thrilled with the response that we've seen on it. 
It is clear that there is a demand there, even much beyond what we thought, and so that is really why we have the constraint that we have. Do I think it will be like the iPad Mini? No, I don't think so. I don't see that.",".

A. Why you're not seeing the elasticity
B. Is the analogy with the iPad mini completely misplaced?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: 
I think the tablet market in general, one of the challenges with the tablet market is that the replacement cycle is materially different than in the smart phone market. As you probably know, we haven't had an issue in customer satisfaction on the iPad. It is incredibly high, and we haven't had an issue with usage of the iPad. The usage is incredibly high. 
But the consumer behavior there is you tend to hold on for very long period of time, before an upgrade. We continue to be very optimistic on the iPad business, and as I have said in my remarks, we believe we are going to have the best compare for iPad revenue this quarter that we have quite some time.",".

Question: What is the ""replacement cycle"" for tablets?
Answer: The replacement cycle for tablets is materially different than in the smart phone market."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: We will report back in July on that one, but I think iPhone has a particularly different kind of cycle to it than the tablet market.

                                                   Okay, and if I could follow-up, Tim. You alluded to replacement cycles and differences between the iPad and the iPhone. My sense was, when you were going through the iPhone 6 cycle, was that you had commented that the upgrade cycle was not materially different. I think your characterization was that it accelerated a bit in the US, but international had grown to be a bigger part of your business, and replacement cycles there were typically a little bit longer.",".

                                                   There's a lot there. Let me just say I don't recall saying the things that you said I said about the upgrade cycle, so let me get that out of the way.",".

Question: What do you think the difference is between the 5s and 6? 
Answer: We think the upgrade cycle for the iPhone is very strong."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: Now let me describe without the specific numbers, the iPhone 6s upgrade cycle that we have measured for the first half of this year, so the first six months of our fiscal year to be precise, is slightly better than the rate that we saw with the iPhone 5s two years ago, but it's lower than the iPhone 6. I don't mean just a hair lower, it's a lot lower.  
Without giving you exact numbers, if we would have the same rate on 6s that we did 6, there would   it will be time for a huge party. It would be a huge difference. The great news from my point of view is, I think we are strategically positioned very well, because we have announced the SE, we are attracting customers that we previously didn't attract.",".

Question: What is the difference between the upgrade cycle for the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6?

The install base is up 80% over the last two years, and so all of those I think bode well, and the switcher comments I made earlier, I wouldn't underestimate that, because that's very important for us in every geography.

                                                   I have a couple of questions. One, Tim, can you talk a bit about what's going on in China? The greater China revenue I think was down 26%.",".

                                                    Thanks, Shannon. That's great. So we're seeing some headwinds in China, but we're still seeing growth there. We're seeing a lot of activity in the luxury market and we're seeing a lot of activity in the education market. So we're seeing a lot of different things happening in China.

Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: You did talk about mainland China, but if you could talk about some of the trends you're seeing there, and how you think it's playing out, and maybe your thoughts on SE adoption within  China as well.                                          
Tim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [27]
                                                   Shannon, thanks for the question. If you take greater China, we include Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China in the greater China segment that you see reported on your data sheet.",".

What are the trends you're seeing in mainland China?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: The vast majority of the weakness in the greater China region sits in Hong Kong, and our perspective on that is, it's a combination of the Hong Kong dollar being pegged to the US dollar, and therefore it carries the burden of the strength of the US dollar, and that has driven tourism, international shopping and trading down significantly compared to what it was in the year ago. 
If you look at mainland China, which is one that I am personally very focused on, we are down 11% in mainland China, on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, we are only down 7%, and the way that we really look at the health or underlying demand is look at sell-through, and if you look at there, we were down 5%.",".

Question: What is the main reason for the weakness in the greater China region?
Answer: The main reason for the weakness in the greater China region is the Hong Kong dollar being pegged to the US dollar, and therefore it carries the burden of the strength of the US dollar."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: Keep in mind that is down 5% on comp a year ago that was up 81%. 
As I  back up from this and look at the larger picture, I think China is not weak, as has been talked about. I see China as   may not have the wind at our backs that we once did, but it's a lot more stable than what I think is the common view of it. We remain really optimistic on China. We opened seven stores there during the quarter. 
We are now at 35. We will open 5 more this quarter to achieve 40, which we had talked about before. And the LTE adoption continues to rise there, but it's got a long way ahead of it.",".

Question: What do you think is the reason for China's slowdown?

Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: And so we continue to be really optimistic about it, and just would ask folks to  look underneath the numbers at the details in them before concluding anything.

                                                   Thanks. My second question is with regard to OpEx leverage, or thinking about when I look at the revenue, your revenue is below our expectations but OpEx is pretty much in line. So how are you thinking about potential for leverage, cost containment, maybe when macro is bad and revenue is under pressure, and how are you juggling that versus the required investment you need to go forward?                                          
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO    [29]
                                                   It is Luca. Of course, we think about it.",".

Question: How do you think about potential for leverage, cost containment, maybe when macro is bad and revenue is under pressure? 
Answer: We think about it constantly."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: We think about it a lot, and so when you look at our results, for example, our OpEx for the quarter, for the March quarter was up 10%, which is the lowest rate that you have seen in years. And when you look within OpEx, you actually see two different dynamics. You see continued significant investments in research and development, because we really believe that's the future of the Company. 
We continue to invest in initiatives and projects ahead of revenue. We had a much broader portfolio that we used to have. We do much more in-house technology development than we used to do a few years ago, which we think is a great investment for us to make.",".

Question: What are the two different dynamics within OpEx?

Answer: The two different dynamics within OpEx are continued significant investments in research and development and in-house technology development."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: And so that parts we didn't need to protect, and we want to continue to invest in the business, right? 
And then when you look at our SG&A portion of OpEx for the March quarter, it was actually down slightly. So obviously we think about it, and of course we look at our revenue trends, and we take measures accordingly. When you look at the guidance that we provided for the June quarter, that 10% year-over-year increase that I mentioned to you for the March quarter goes down to a range of 7% to 9% up, and again, the focus is on making investments in Road and continuing to run SG&A extremely tightly, and in a very disciplined way. 
As you know, our E2R, expense to revenue ratio, is around 10%.",".

Question: What is the E2R for Apple Inc.?
Answer: The E2R for Apple Inc. is 10%."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: It's something that we are very proud of, it's a number that is incredibly competitive in our industry, and we want to continue to keep it that way.

Do you view it going forward as a primary driver of earnings, or do you view it, and you mentioned platforms in terms of your operating systems, which I would agree with.",".

A: We view services as a primary driver of earnings going forward, and we continue to invest in the business."
Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: In that scenario I would argue it's more a supporter of the ecosystem, and a supporter of the hardware margins over time, and therefore somewhat subservient to hardware. It's great that it's growing, but longer-term, I would view its role as more creating an ecosystem that supports the high margins on the hardware, as opposed to independently driving earnings.

As we said earlier, the purchase value of the installed base services grew by 27% during the quarter, which was an acceleration over the previous quarter, and the value of it hit   was just shy of $10 billion.

                                                   Okay, and then going back to the upgrades of the installed base, you have clearly mentioned that you've  pulled forward some demand, which makes sense, but there does seem to be a lengthening of the upgrade cycle, particularly in the US. AT&T and Verizon have talked about that. Investors I think perceive  that maybe the marginal improvements on the phone might be less currently, and could be less going forward. At the same time, I think you just announced that you can get the upgrade program online, which I guess potentially could shorten it. Do you believe that upgrade cycles are currently lengthening, and can continue to do so?

Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: If you compare to the 5s, what we are seeing is the upgrade rate today is slightly higher, or that there are more people upgrading, if you will, in a similar time period, in terms of a rate, than the 5s. But if you compare to 6, you would clearly arrive at the opposite conclusion. I think it depends on people's reference points, and we thought it very important in this call to be very clear and transparent about what we're seeing. I think in retrospect, you could look at it and say, maybe the appropriate measure is more to the 5s, and I think everybody intuitively thought that the upgrades were accelerated with the 6, and in retrospect, when you look at the periods, they clearly were.

                                                   Yes, thanks for fitting me in. I wanted to start with a general, more general question. I guess, Tim, this one is aimed at you. As you think about where you thought things were going to head last quarter, when you reported to us, and how it's changed this quarter, obviously it's kind of a disappointing demand environment. Can you just help us understand what maybe the top two or three things are that have changed? And so as we walk away from this, we understand what the differences are, and what the direction of change is? Then I have a follow-up.

                                                    I think you're probably indirectly asking about our trough comment, if you will, from last quarter. And when we made that, we did not contemplate or comprehend that we were going to make a $2 billion-plus reduction in channel inventory during this quarter. So if you factor that in and look at true customer demand, which is the way that we look at internally, I think you'll find a much more reasonable comparison.

Frankly from first read, we don't anticipate that they are going to have any material impact on our tax situation. Some of them relate to inversion transactions, obviously that's not an issue for us.

As you know, we are the largest US taxpayer by a wide margin, and we already pay full US tax on all the profits from the sales that we make in the United States, so we don't expect them to have any impact on us on tax reform. I will let Tim continue to  provide more color, but we've been strong advocates for comprehensive corporate tax reform in this country. We continue to do that. We think a reform of the tax code would have significant benefits for the entire US economy, and we remain optimistic that we are going to get to a point where we can see that tax reform enacted.

Edited version Q1 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: <Sync id=""L173""/>In constant currency, when you look at it for the March quarter, revenue would be down between 5% and 10%.  <Sync id=""L174""/>So we are looking at a 400 basis point impact from foreign exchange for the March quarter.

Edited version Q1 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: <Sync id=""L248""/>To start, just on iPhones, it looks like your guidance implies about a 15% to 20% unit decline in iPhones for fiscal Q2, which I think, unless you really see a change in demand profile in the second half, suggests that iPhone units will decline year-over-year for FY16.",".

<Sync id=""L249""/>And I'd like you to address that question, because the obvious follow-up questions are is that because you believe the smartphone market won't grow or because Apple may be reaching saturation in the market? <Sync id=""L250""/>Is that because Apple's replacement cycle accelerated last year and is decelerating this year and that's why we'll see a decline in units?  
<Sync id=""L251""/>Or is there something about Apple's ability to gain share in a market where the market is moving to much lower price points?  <Sync id=""L252""/>But I'm wondering, and Tim, maybe you're best to answer it, if you can address what appears likely to be a decline in iPhone units and how we put that in the context of how we should think about that, given some healthy data around switchers that you highlighted.

Q: What is the reason for the decline in iPhone units?
A: The decline in iPhone units is due to a number of factors, including a replacement cycle that has decelerated this year and a market where the market is moving to much lower price points."

Thank you very much for the question. Tim, can you talk a little bit about your thoughts on investments? You made the Didi investment this quarter.  
Obviously you continue to make acquisitions over time. We just saw   you invested in buying some of the carpool karaoke. I'm just curious as to how you're thinking about where you're putting your investment dollars for more of an acquisition or a potential equity stake standpoint as you look at overall capital allocation?

Q: Can you talk about the rationale behind the Didi investment?
A: We made the Didi investment because we believe in the potential of the Chinese market and the team at Didi. We're excited to work with them and help them grow."

Shannon, we obviously invest a ton of capital in our business itself to support research and development and the production of our products and that's the main source of our capital.  However, we're constantly looking on the outside for great talent and great intellectual property, and we have been buying companies on average every three to four weeks or so.  We continue to do that, and we think we've made some really great choices there. 
In terms of the investment in Didi, it was a unusual investment in that as you know, we don't have a long history of doing a lot of these.  But, we have done some before. We invested in ARM in the early days.  
We invested in Akamai and a few other companies so it wasn't the first.",".

And, three, we think that we'll learn a lot about the business in the Chinese market even beyond what we currently know, and Didi has an incredible team there.  That's the rationale for why we did that. Would we do more investments? 
Yes, but it's not something that you'll see a whole string of from us, but we will constantly look for things that are smart to do.

For the September quarter.  So, it's essentially, we are guiding GM flat to slightly down sequentially. 
On the positive side, we are going to have leverage because we are guiding to a sequential increase in revenue, and we expect to have positive mix as we get into the September quarter.",".

Question: How do you think about commodity pricing and mix of the new products?
Answer: We are thinking about it in terms of gross margin. We are expecting to have a positive mix as we get into the September quarter."
Edited version Q3 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call:  This positive is being offset more or less by what we call product transition costs which are typical of this time of the year for us.

Shannon, on the commodity side and for the September quarter, we see NAND being pretty much in balance while DRAM and LCDs and other major commodities remain in an oversupply situation.

You mentioned the 451 is finding business interest in phones, but their survey on consumers actually finds the lowest level of expectation for purchases in the next three months since 2008. 
You've seen the upgrade numbers from the carriers are quite low so it seems like it's still a very tough demand environment.  So, where is the strength coming from in the September quarter?                                          
Tim Cook,  Apple Computer, Inc. - CEO     [12]
                                        
Steve, we aren't going to get into products or product transitions.  However, we've taken what we've learned from last quarter, and we did see a number of encouraging signs. Luca talked about the number of countries that we saw double-digit growth in during the quarter from Japan to Brazil to India.",".

Some even stronger numbers than that in Russia.  So, there's a number of countries that we saw strong signals from that perspective. We also are very happy with the switcher rate that we saw.  
Our highest ever recorded, and the number of switchers through the nine months or the highest absolute numbers that we've ever had.  And so, when we look at that and then we look at the things going on in our other products and services, and we think services will continue to grow very briskly.  We've made our best estimate of where we think we'll come in, and that's $45.5 billion to $47.5 billion.

Edited version Q3 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call:  You talk about the four operating systems essentially as platforms which I agree with.  And, it's just interesting to me because Apple has such control over the vertical integration of your products, and yet you've somehow been able to grasp the openness that's required for platforms.  
And, I think that's reflected in WWDC as you pointed out.  Opening up APIs and so forth on messaging, and you made the case there for Apps versus messaging and the anti-bot argument. 
Just curious is that the way   am I characterizing this roughly correctly in term of how you think about the business?  And, how are you managing that internally in terms of having this vertically integrated somewhat closed view of the hardware and yet this pretty open platform where the value is created externally?

Well, we think to have a great platform you have to have a really healthy ecosystem, and so we're really proud of the developer community and the fact that developers are earning a lot more money in writing for iOS than other apps. We think that the best experience for users include apps, and so we want to do everything that we can do to continue building that. 
We now have over 2 million apps in the app store and are more focused these days on discovery and other things to bring more great apps to the service because there's so many out there.  So, that's what we're doing.",".

What is the rationale for CarPlay?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: Luca, as it relates to gross margin, the guidance today is very similar to what you've provided over the last five years in terms of gross margin guidance in September versus June.  And, the variances that you walked through in response to Shannon's questions are very similar to the dynamics that you see in any September quarter, but there's an added factor this time around which is you don't have the $4 million of high ASP, high margin inventory drain in September like you did in the June quarter.  
So, I guess I'd just pushback and ask why gross margin guidance wouldn't be even better?  Is it the more balanced NAND environment that Tim spoke to?  Or, is there something else impacting the guidance?

Well, Katy, I've talked about these elements at a broad level.  Of course, there are degrees of positive impact, right.  We, for example, on the mix front every cycle is slightly different on our product mix, and so that clearly has an impact on gross margin.  
The other thing that we need to keep in mind as we step back for a second and now we have gone through a couple of cycles where the US dollar has strengthened.  As you know, we work with our hedging program where we get protection from FX fluctuations in the short term, when these hedges roll off over time, we end up replacing them with new hedging contracts at the spot rate.",".

What is the impact on gross margin from the mix of products sold?
The impact on gross margin from the mix of products sold is that it has a small impact on gross margin."
Edited version Q3 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call:  
And so, versus September of 2014, for example, the US dollar is now strengthened on average against international currencies by about 15%.  I think we need to accept and now we are living in this stronger US dollar environment.  We've taken a lot of actions on the cost side, on the pricing side, and obviously with hedges.  But, we need to deal with the situation, and that's where we are right now. 
We feel that 37.5% to 38% given the new FX environment, I think, says a lot about all the work that we've done on the cost side to get there.  Just to give you a sense on a year-over-year basis when I look at foreign exchange, that has an impact of almost 300 basis points on our margins.

Somebody mentioned that US carriers have reported really weak upgrade rates, not necessarily for iPhone but across their installed base.  The press is discussing only modest technology upgrades in your next iPhone cycle.  
So, those data points would lead investors to believe that the upgrade rate will be low.  But, curious if you have a different view?  Thank you.

It took a little time to realize that. The iPhone 6 was significantly higher than that, and so it likely accelerated upgrades that would have been in the current year ahead of those.  And so, what the future holds we'll see, but I'm very optimistic about the future because I see so many signs that are positive. 
I see an installed base that has gotten incredibly large. I see a switcher rate that is the highest ever. I see the Smartphone itself, lead by iPhone, becoming even more instrumental and important to peoples lives.

And so, I see all of those things as vectors that are incredibly positive. I also really like what I've seen with the iPhone SE, and the fact that it's opening the door to customers that we weren't reaching before and likely convincing some people to upgrade that wanted a smaller form factor but wanted to stay with iPhone.

Yes, thank you. You commented about the significant inventory drawdown in the quarter   $3.6 billion on the revenue side.  So, sell-through was $46 billion effectively. Over 4 million iPhones, suggesting that sell-through iPhone sales were $45 million. 
When I look to your guidance for Q4, I actually have the opposite question of a previous question which is in light of the true sell-through rate which seems to reflect better than normal seasonality in Q3.  Likely some contribution and elasticity from the SE.",".

I added that to the $40.4 million so that would suggest close to $45 million on a sell-through basis, so that was the basis for my observation. I was wondering if we could, if I could direct one at Tim.",".

You talked about the upgrade cycle and how it  is elongated relative to the iPhone 6, and that it's similar to what you saw with the 5s. My belief is that one of the bigger longer term concerns for Apple is that the replacement cycle could just structurally elongate over time particularly as your installed base of customers becomes less affluent and more international.  So, I guess my question is you have a mechanism which is the Apple upgrade program which takes replacement cycle out of the equation and puts people on buying the phone as a service.",".

Question: What is the mechanism by which the Apple upgrade program takes replacement cycle out of the equation?
Answer: The Apple upgrade program is a service that allows customers to buy the phone as a service. This removes the need to replace the phone every two years."

I'd welcome any comments on how that program is doing?  And then, just more broadly, is Apple thinking about ways to sell not only the iPhone, but more of its products on a monthly-type subscription basis perhaps in a more bundled fashion so that you can add more predictability to what is now largely a transactional revenue model?                                           
Tim Cook,  Apple Computer, Inc. - CEO     [27]
                                        
The iPhone demand is made up, as you know, of upgraders, switchers, and new to Smartphone.  And so, if you take it in the reverse order for a minute and look at the new to Smartphone, the penetration around   Smartphone penetration right now around the world at the end of December was 42%.

It is true that a lot of those are in emerging markets, but we have done   we've had reasonable business success in several emerging markets.  So, we don't enter into those with no experience although we will enter into them humbly. 
On the switcher side, we really like what we're seeing, and we think that from a user point of view, as the Smartphone itself becomes more and more essential to people's daily lives which is a part of what I had talked about before.  A part of bringing it into the home in a bigger way and in the car and at work and so forth.  
We think people will put more and more focus on what they're buying, and the thing that Apple does best which is provide this killer experience.",".

What is the ""killer experience"" that Apple provides?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call:  A killer user experience that's integrated across their lives, I think, becomes more important, and I think that really plays to our advantage. 
I also think that the deployment of AI technology is something that we will excel at because of our focus on user experience and so I like that. From an upgrade point of view, there are pluses and minuses as I see it. A plus is that more and more people have already joined upgrade programs. 
Some of these programs like the one that you referenced that we've done replaces the iPhone every year. There are also carriers that have similar kind of plans where they also replace or change out the iPhone every year. Others have an 18-month clock.",".

Some have a 24-month clock, and there are even some that have a 30-month clock  So, there's various time schedules there.  As of today, there are obviously a lot more people on those programs than ever before because they just started and really got underway in a big way last year, in a smaller way two years ago.  We'll see more of those this coming fall. 
The minus side is that the bifurcation of the Smartphone from the service itself has a plus and a minus into it. The subsidy, the lack of that   and this is more of a US phenomenon than the rest of the world.",".

What is the ""plus"" side of the bifurcation of the Smartphone from the service itself?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call:  Some of that can be a shock for people that we're used to paying $199 for their Smartphone and they come back in and pay less for the service but they pay more for their Smartphone.  
There's lots of pluses and minuses on this.  But, overall, as I look at this for Apple   and this is not a statement on the industry itself   but for Apple, I'm very optimistic.

Good afternoon,  Tim, you gave some nice data points around Apple Pay. Can you remind us is this a business that ultimately impacts the services line in any measurable way?  Or, is Apple Pay generally about selling iPhones?  
And, separately is that, when you just take a step back and look at the proof point that augmented reality theme has had with this whole Pokemon phenomenon.  How does it impact how you think about the future? I assume you think about it.",".

I'm curious what goes on in your mind when you see all of that?  Thanks.                                          
Tim Cook,  Apple Computer, Inc. - CEO     [37]
                                        
Yes, on the Apple pay side, the revenues from Apple pay are in the services line. The growth is astronomical, but the base is very small.  So, for today, Apple pay is very much about a great feature for our customers so that they can pay in a very simple, private, and secure way. 
In terms of AR and the Pokemon phenomenon, it's incredible what has happened there. I think it's a testament to what happens with innovative Apps and the whole ecosystem and the power of being a developer being able to press a button, so to speak, and offer their product around the world.",".

What do you think is the key to Apple's success in the mobile space?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call:  This certain developer has elected not to go worldwide yet because of the pressure on their servers, et cetera, because of the demand.  
But, I'm sure that they will over time. It also does show, as you point out, that AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run. 
We think there's great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity, and so we're investing and the number one thing is to make sure our products work well with other developers' kind of products like Pokemon.  That's the reason you see so many of the iPhones out in the wild right now chasing Pokemon.",".

I know there's people that want to call it a new computer platform, and we will see. There's a tendency in this industry to call everything new the next computer platform.  However, that said, I think AR can be huge. So, we'll see whether it's the next platform, but regardless, it will be huge.

Edited version Q3 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: Just want to follow-up, Tim, if I could related to the R&D pace of growth. 
Clearly, a lot of momentum there over the last couple of years, but we're just trying to figure out how much of that is dedicated to existing products and services versus what's next?  And, can you give us a sense in terms of when investors should think about the ROI coming back to them from the R&D perspective?  And, corollary to that, does that   is it really restricted just to products and services currently?  
Or, can we see more of a cloud services apparatus evolve over time where you do more and more in the Enterprise just given the core chips with SAP and Cisco and IBM?  And then, my follow-up for Luca is around ASPs for the iPhone.",".

We keep getting a lot of questions around SE in terms of how cannibalistic could it be to the core iPhone franchise?  Are you seeing any moderation in terms of the ASP pressures there?                                          
Tim Cook,  Apple Computer, Inc. - CEO     [44]
                                        
On the R&D growth, we do continue to invest significantly in R&D. The growth rates are still large on a year-over-year basis and Luca can share the exact ones, but I think the recent quarter was in the [mid-20s] for R&D. The balance of the Company, we're managing more flattish from a year-over-year point of view. 
The products that are in R&D   there is quite a bit of investment in there for products and services that are not currently shipping or derivations of what is currently shipping.",".

Q: Can you give us a sense of how much of the R&D growth is coming from new products versus refinement of existing products?

Mark, on the ASP question.  Talked about $595 in Q3.  It's down $65 on a year-over-year basis.  
Keep in mind about $20 of that $65 is foreign exchange.  So, during the quarter, we had this combination of starting with no SE units in channel inventory so we had to do at least a partial channel [sale] that obviously had an impact on ASPs.  And then, the other element was the fact that we've reduced more than 4 million units of channel inventory on the high end.",".

What was the impact of starting with no SE units in channel inventory and reducing more than 4 million units of channel inventory on the high end?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call:  
So, the combination of these two things, obviously, had an impact on ASPs.  But, I think as I said or Tim said during the prepared remarks, we do expect iPhone ASP to improve sequentially as we move into the September quarter because these two factors that I just mentioned.  I'm not going to repeat.  
On cannibalization, of course, we've got limited experience because the phone has been in the market just for a few weeks.  But, when we look at our survey data on iPhone SE, as Tim was saying, we believe that the SE is doing exactly what it was intended which is we are seeing a higher rate of new-to-iPhone customers which is obviously very important to us as we bring new people into the iOS ecosystem.",".

What is the ""rate of new-to-iPhone customers"" that Apple believes the SE is generating?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call:  And, we see a higher rate of previous iPhone owners that really prefer the four-inch phone factor. 
We have not seen clear evidence of cannibalization from iPhone 6s or 6s plus.  Of course, there's always going to be some level of cannibalization, but really to us what is much more relevant is the much bigger opportunity to bring more people into the iOS ecosystem.

Edited version Q3 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call:  So, I understand there is other drivers going into the September quarter, but just to be clear, the 4 million or so units that you didn't sell-through that were depleted out of channel inventory, those are relatively high gross margin as well.  That's just a clarification.  
And then, for Tim, on the services side.  As Apple has spoken more and more loudly I guess over the last three or four quarters, I just think about some of the comments you've made about the TV market and how its still been in the '60s and '70s and the experience hasn't changed.",".

Gene Munster,  Piper Jaffray & Co. - Analyst    [2]
                                        
Good afternoon and congratulations. Tim, now that we're a month in the iPhone 7, are you seeing anything measurable in terms of the growing trend of annual upgrades?   Second is, historically in terms of new product categories, you have always looked for you unique advantage before getting into a segment.  And, I'm curious about the car.",".

1. Yes, we are seeing an annual upgrade trend in iPhone 7 sales. 
2. We believe that the unique advantage for Apple in the car market is its brand and its customer relationships."
Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: There are a lot of rumors out there and would like your perspective on how you think about an advantage that Apple could add in the auto space?                                           
Tim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [3]
                                        
In terms of iPhone 7, Gene, the carriers that had upgrade plans, the information that we have from them is that the demand is very robust. But, from a worldwide point of view, the truth is that demand is outstripping supply in the vast majority of places, particularly on the iPhone 7 Plus. And so, it's   we're in a situation at the moment, it's difficult in the early weeks to be able to differentiate. But, on an anecdotal basis, it's clear the upgrade programs are a win.",".

1. What is the demand for the iPhone 7? 
2. How do you think carriers will be able to differentiate between the iPhone 7 and other models?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: 
I can't speak about rumors, but as you know, we look for ways that we can improve the experience and the customers' experience on different sets of products, and we're always looking at new things.  The car space, in general, is an area that it's clear that there's a lot of technologies that will either become available or will be able to revolutionize the car experience. So, it's interesting from that point of view, but certainly nothing to announce today.

Just one quick follow-up in terms of the supply. Do you think we'll be at equilibrium by the end of the quarter, for iPhone supply?                                          
Tim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [5]
                                        
It's hard to say. I believe that on iPhone 7, we will. On iPhone 7 Plus, I'm not sure.",".

Q: What do you think about the potential for iPhone 7 Plus to be more popular than iPhone 7?
A: I'm not sure."
Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: I wouldn't say yes at this point because the underlying demand looks extremely strong on both products, but particularly on the iPhone 7 Plus versus our forecast going into the product launch.

Thanks. Good afternoon.  Luca, can you help us understand what's embedded in revenue guidance for the extra week as well as any rebuilding of channel inventory, given all the major products are running below target. Just trying to get at whether you see revenue, and in particular, iPhone growth year on year on more of a sell-out basis when you adjust for those two factors.",".

Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - Senior Vice President of Worldwide Sales and Marketing    [10]

Thanks, Katy. So our guidance for the fourth quarter is $51.5 billion, and we expect revenue to be between $51.3 billion and $52.7 billion. We don't have any rebuilding of channel inventory in mind, but we do see some seasonality in terms of iPhone sales. So we're expecting a bit more seasonality in terms of iPhone sales in the fourth quarter versus other quarters."
Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: And then, I have a follow-up.                                          
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO    [10]
                                        
Sure. Let me say a few things on the 14th week and revenue outlook for the December quarter. Keep in mind that the December quarter a year ago for us was an all-time quarterly revenue record. 
We think we can grow this year. As Tim said, the interest from customers on iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is very strong. The strength of our services business, you've seen we've grown 24% in September. We think we can continue to grow very well into the December quarter. 
You mentioned the 14th week and the few extra days do help us this quarter, but I think it's important to keep in mind that there are other factors that go and offset these extra few days.",".

What other factors offset the extra few days in the December quarter?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: As you know, the launch timing of the new iPhone is different this year. We had the first nine days of sales this year hit Q4. There were only two days last year. So, the cadence has moved more towards Q4 this year versus Q1 last year. As you know, we increased iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units in the first quarter of 2016. 
As Tim said, we are very supply-constrained on iPhone 7 Plus this year. We are simply more supply-constrained this year than we were a year ago. And then, keep in mind there were a couple of things that affected compare as well, which is the fact that a year ago we had an award for a patent infringement of $548 million which is obviously a one-off item that is not going to repeat this year.",".

Question: What was the increase in iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units?
Answer: The increase in iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units was due to the fact that Apple increased the number of iPhones that it shipped through its retail channels."
Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call:  And, also, the foreign exchange environment remains difficult, and we expect FX to be about $650 million headwind on a year-over-year basis into the December quarter. 
So, I hope that gives you a bit of a sense that when you take into account all these factors, we believe that this is a good guidance for the December quarter.                                          
Katy Huberty,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [11]
                                        
That's great color. Thank you for that. Follow-up for Tim. What should we read into the fact that R&D has more than doubled over the past three years, while sales growth was one-fifth of that. Are R&D investments just less efficient than they were in the Company's history?  Or, should we think about that as incremental spend for products that haven't yet come to market?                                          
Tim Cook,  Apple Inc.",".

What should we read into the fact that R&D has more than doubled over the past three years, while sales growth was one-fifth of that?"

There's clearly some amount of R&D that are on products that today are in the development phase that have not reached the market. And so, that's a part of it. 
We feel really great about the things that we've got. We've also put a lot of emphasis on our services business as well and on making the ecosystem even better. And so, we're very much   we're confidently investing in the future, and that's the reason you see the R&D spend increasing.

What is the company's outlook for its services business? 
The company's outlook for its services business is positive."
Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: The first, Tim, can you talk a bit more about China?  Just how you're thinking about it?  Where you're seeing pressure? I know you mentioned that you expect to see a significant rebound during the first quarter.  But, what are your customers telling you about the demand in China?                                          
Tim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [17]
                                        
It's a good question, Shannon. So, to back up from our results for the quarter, the 90-day clock and look at the full year of 2016.  We were down 17% compared to the FY15 which was up 84% from the previous year. So, if you look at 2014 to 2016, the revenue grew 52%, and the CAGR was 23% which really are pretty good results.",".

What was the CAGR for China? 

The CAGR for China was 23%."
Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: 
Also, as you probably know, the FY16 performance was hurt by the devaluation of the currency which affected it about 3%. So, the underlying business performance was 14% down.  And so, why was it down? There's lots of reasons, but the largest one in our view is that when you look at what happened in 2015 in China, we had a surge of upgraders that came into the market for the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus, and the upgrade rate increased relatively more in Greater China than elsewhere around the world. 
And so, when that upgrade rate in FY16 returned to a more normal upgrade rate, which would be akin to what we saw with the iPhone 5S [as a point], it had further to fall. So, that's the main reason in our view that you see a difference.",".

Question: What was the main reason for the 14% decline in Apple's FY16 performance?
Answer: The main reason for the 14% decline in Apple's FY16 performance was that the devaluation of the currency which affected it about 3%."
Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: 
Now, that spun or created another issue for us because we didn't forecast that accurately. So, in Q1 of last year, we put in too much channel inventory and had been resetting the channel inventory over the few quarters that came beyond it or came after it. So, those two issues, which really the main one is really the first one and the second one was a symptom of it, are in our views the main issue. 
Now, looking forward, the response to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has been very positive. It's very hard to gauge demand, as you know, when you're selling everything you're making. And so, we'll find out more through the quarter, but we're confident enough to give you guidance that we're returning to growth this quarter which obviously feels very good for us.",".

Q: What was the main issue with Apple's Q1 2017 results?
A: The main issue was that they over-produced their channel inventory, which caused them to reset it and caused them to miss their guidance."
Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: 
And, from a longer term point of view, out of the 90-day clocks and so forth, we are very bullish on China. We continue to see a middle class that is booming there. There might be some sort of a new normal in the economy, but a new normal there is still a good growth rate. And so, with the number of middle class   people growing into the middle class and the LTE adoption rate being still fairly low, around 45%, 50% or so, then I think we continue to have a really good opportunity there. And so, we continue to focus significantly in China.

Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: I don't mean like the smaller ones that you've done at a normal cadence, but there was clearly a fairly large one announced at least this week in the content world.  And, especially if you find a way to have [cash] repatriation of some of the cash at a low tax rate possibly with the next administration.  So, just if you can give an overall view of how you think about acquisitions that might be a little bit larger than normal?

Yes, thank you. I have a question and a follow-up, please. I guess a cynic could say Apple is benefiting from an extra week this quarter and is benefiting from Samsung being in complete disarray.  And yet, from your guidance, it's unclear that iPhone unit growth will be up or certainly not up more than low single digits implied from your guidance.",".

Question: Why do you think iPhone unit growth will be up or not up more than low single digits implied from your guidance? 
Answer: We believe that iPhone unit growth will be up because we expect demand for iPhone to be high and we are expanding our distribution channels."
Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: And, I appreciate some of the issues around channel inventory build and the timing of the launch. 
But, if I just stand back from that and say you have terrific new products.  Your major competitor is laying down.  You have an enormous   you have a significant contribution from an extra week, arguably, 7% or 8%, and yet the iPhone growth is sort of flattish.  What does that really say about how investors should think about iPhone on a sustained basis growing forward?

Toni, let me take this one. I think you mentioned a number of the things that are affecting us in the December quarter, and I went through them with Katy just a few minutes ago.",".

1. What does the flat iPhone growth suggest about the long-term prospects for the iPhone?
2. What do you think is driving the slowdown in China?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: 
You're right.  We've got an extra few days. You know very well the launch timing is different. You know that we increased iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units a year ago. I mentioned two issues that affect us, the one-timer from a year ago that you obviously need to exclude from the compare and the FX that is the reality of our business right now. 
But, maybe the most important element of this is the fact that we are supply-constrained on 7 and 7 Plus. And so, when you talk about other competitors, it's not particularly relevant to us right now because we are selling everything that we can produce. And so, when we look at all these things in its totality, we think that for the total Company, of course, we believe that revenue is going to grow.",".

Question: What is the most important element of this?

Answer: The most important element of this is the fact that we are selling everything that we can produce."
Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call:  You know that we don't get into specific product from a unit standpoint giving guidance. And so, we feel very confident about the trajectory for the Company and for iPhone going forward.                                          
Toni Sacconaghi,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [26]
                                        
Tim, if I could ask you one, please. You've talked in the past about television being an area of intense interest."," that investors might want to know about the Company's plans in television.

We believe that Apple's products and services in television are unique and offer a great experience for consumers."
Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: I was wondering if you could reaffirm that statement? Is that still the case? 
And then, additionally, given what's happening with acquisitions, how broadly you think about the role of content?  Apple has started creating on a very limited scale some of its own content, and whether you think content creation and ownership is important to Apple?  Or, whether Apple ultimately sees its place in the value chain as being more around ecosystem and distribution?

Thank you. That's a great question. So, on a per-user basis, services grew at a rate of about 60% in 2016. And that's really driven by the growth of App Store and iTunes services, which are both subscription-based businesses. And then, of course, there's also iCloud, which is a subscription-based business as well."

Simona, the installed base number is something that we talk about periodically. Last time we talked about it was in the January call. It is growing. Our installed base is growing very well which is very important for us. It's growing on all major products, and it's growing, of course, in total. 
When you look at our services revenue, the growth of the services revenues has been accelerating during the course of the year. During a period when, as you know, our revenue came down slightly. So, what that means in practice is that what we are seeing with our customers that consume our services is that the people that are actually taking advantage of our services, over time, they tend to spend more and more on our services.",".

We've got customers who are very engaged with our products. They're very loyal, and so you see this upward trajectory of our services business. It's not only with the App store but several categories that are growing very well for us. Tim mentioned Apple Music, but we've got other parts of the business that continue to do well.

The increasing focus on artificial intelligence is the increasing number of companies that are incorporating artificial intelligence into their products."

Tim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [33]
                                        
I think that, to answer your second question first, I think that most people would like an assistant with them all the time. And, we live in a mobile society. People are constantly moving from home to work and to other things that they may be doing. And so, the advantage of having an assistant on your phone is it's with you all the time. That doesn't say that there's not a nice market for a home one. I'm not making that point.",".

How important is it to have a dedicated home assistant versus just having the phone as the home assistant?

I think it's important to have a dedicated home assistant, because you want to make sure that the data is being collected in a way that is appropriate and that you're getting the most out of the assistant."
Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: 
I'm just saying on a balanced point of view I think the usage of one on the phone will likely be much greater. In fact, you can just look at Siri today, and this is now accelerating with iOS 10 and the Mac. But, we've been getting 2 billion requests a week for Siri. 
And so, it's very large, and to the best of our knowledge, we've shipped more assisted, enabled devices than probably anyone out there. Our focus is on this worldwide. And so, it's not only a US focus, but we want to deliver a great experience around the world and deliver globally.  So, we've put a lot of the energy into doing that. 
In terms of the balance between privacy and AI, this is a long conversation.",".

What is Apple's plan for balancing privacy and AI?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call:  But, at a high level, I think it's a false tradeoff that people would like you to believe that you have to give up privacy in order to have AI do something for you. We don't buy that. It may take a different kind of work. It might take more thinking. But, I don't think we should throw our privacy away. 
It's like the age-old argument about privacy versus security. We should have both. It shouldn't be making a choice. And so, that at a high level is how we see it.

Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call: So, Tim and Luca, you saw that you could raise the ASP on the iPhone 7 Plus by $20, and you're completely sold out. So, clearly this device plays a central role in our lives, so much that owners probably look at that incremental cost as a great tradeoff to get the best device out there. 
As you see more and more features being added into iPhones, do you conceptually expect that you're anywhere close to the point where raising ASPs further would be net-disruptive to demand?  Or, do you see more room to raise ASPs over time as you add incremental features.  And, I have a follow-up.

So, we're getting an incredible amount of feedback there. We also get incredible feedback on the iPhone 7. 
But, the mix that we projected on an iPhone 7 Plus is short of what the reality is. So, we are chasing supply there. In terms of the ASP, the way we think about it is we want to charge a fair price. And so, we don't want to charge more than that, and we think it's worth being fair. And so, that's how we look at it.

Great. Thanks for the clarification. And, Tim, this year, we saw carrier incentives come back to force, post the launch of the iPhone 7, 7 Plus.  Two years ago, there was a giant upgrade cycle from the iPhone 6, 6 Plus. 
Do you think every couple of years we are likely to see carrier incentives come back into play given worries around customer churn?  Thereby, making the phone even more affordable?  Thanks.

We clearly saw that this year. There's a lot of competition for customers in the US which I think is the market that you're talking about. Whether that will happen every two years, I don't know. But, I suspect that any time there are large numbers of customers that have a phone that's in that two-year kind of range that it tends to be a sweet spot, and I think you probably will see a lot of people trying to recruit those customers.

However, one of the key reasons for that is the infrastructure hasn't been there.

Rod, let me give you some details both on a sequential basis, and I'll give you also something on a year-over-year basis because maybe that's where the disconnect comes from looking at last year's gross margins in the December quarter. 
On a sequential basis, we're essentially guiding to some improvement in gross margins. We had 38% both in the June quarter and in the September quarter. We're guiding slightly higher for the December quarter because on the positive we're going to have, of course, better leverage and the mix in the December quarter tends to be better.",".

On a year-over-year basis, keep in mind that last year we did in Q1 we did 40%, around 40%, 41%.  But, there's a couple of things that I think need to be considered before doing a year-over-year compare. And, it's a fact that last year we had this award for a patent infringement of $548 million that is at the gross margin level is 40 Bps. 
And then, we've got the FX situation which I mentioned before which is worth another 60, 70 Bps.",".

It is very, very important, I think, for investors to understand that what's happened during the last two years. During the last two years the US dollar has appreciated by 15% over the basket of currencies where we do business. And, we are a Company that generates two-thirds of our revenues outside the United States. 15% appreciation of the US dollar. So, on a year-over-year basis, just 2016 over 2015, was 340 Bps impact from foreign exchange. 
This is something that we have offset almost entirely through a number of initiatives going from pricing actions to cost initiatives to our hedging program.",".

Question: What initiatives did Apple Inc. take to offset the foreign exchange impact from the US dollar's 15% appreciation?
Answer: Apple Inc. took pricing actions, cost initiatives, and a hedging program to offset the foreign exchange impact from the US dollar's 15% appreciation."
Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Apple Inc Earnings Call:  But, at some point, the strong dollar becomes the new normal, and we need to work with that.

Okay. Great. Thanks, Luca. And then, Tim, I wanted to ask you, this question comes up once in a while.  But, I just wanted to ask you if you could talk to us a little bit about the arguments on both sides of the dividend question. 
Apple seems to be perpetually undervalued. It's a very large Company.  It is getting harder and harder to grow. Your payout ratio is significantly below the S&P 500.",".

We review the capital return annually, and we've established a cadence now to announce our thinking on that every April. So, we have a robust discussion around the dividend and the buyback. 
We very much believe that Apple is very undervalued, and so we're investing with confidence in the Company that we know really well. And so, that thinking has I think proven out over time, and I think been very good for our shareholders.",".

We had a gross margin of 38%. And then, on the question of memory, I think it's important to understand that our memory business is a very small part of our overall business. So, we're not really impacted by the current market conditions. We have contracts in place that will allow us to continue to generate revenue and earnings. And then, on the question of Qualcomm, we do not have any holdbacks with Qualcomm. So, we're not really impacted by that.

And so there's 1,000-plus in the App Store right now. I think this is very much like in 2008, when we fired the gun in the overall App Store.",".

A couple questions. The first, Tim, can you talk a bit about how you're thinking in terms of the lineup? You go from $340   and this is for iPhone. You go from $349 to above $1,000, and it appears that you probably sold a fair amount of the lower end, perhaps that was just some of the switchers in China and maybe drove some of the growth in China in terms of market share.",".

Yes, so we're really happy with the growth in China. We continue to see a lot of interest in our products there. And we're seeing good demand for our new iPhone models as well. So we're really happy with the trajectory of the business.

And then secondly, I wanted to ask about the Services segment. You mentioned that you're seeing some good growth there. Can you give us a little bit more color on what's driving that growth?

So we're seeing good growth in Services because we're seeing more people using our products and services. We're seeing more people using our products to do things like make payments and manage their finances. And we're also seeing more people using our products to get access to information and to get services from us."

Yes, in terms of what we saw in Q4, you can probably tell from the ASP, we had good success, I would say, through the different iPhones. And we've tried hard to have an iPhone that is as affordable as possible for people that really want an iPhone that may have a more limited budget, and we've got some iPhones that are really great for that market.",".

Great. And then, in terms of services, $8.5 billion, up 34%. Can you talk about some of the portions of that, that outperformed? How sustainable? You mentioned China in terms of significant growth in services."," about services.

What are the key drivers of growth in services?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Apple Inc Earnings Call: But I'm just curious, it's a pretty remarkable number, so I'm curious what the drivers were.                                         
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [15]
                                        
Yes, Shannon, it's Luca. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there was a $640 million adjustment. There was a one-off change. And it's important to call it out because, of course, it's a one-off. And so, the underlying growth rate for services in the quarter was fantastic, was 24%, the highest growth rate that we've had for services during fiscal '17. So the business is going incredibly well. I would highlight maybe 3 of these businesses within services. The App Store set a new all-time record. It's growing incredibly well. The number of paying accounts continues to grow very strongly, and that's very, very important to us for the App Store business.",".

What was the one-off change that drove the $640 million adjustment in Q4?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Apple Inc Earnings Call: Apple Music was up   subscriptions were up 75% year-over-year. We're getting the highest conversion rates that we've had since the launch of the service. And so we turned the corner in music. You remember that a few years ago, we were actually declining in music; now with the streaming service in addition to the download business, the business is growing again. And that really helps the growth rate for the entire Services business. iCloud is a service that continues to grow very strong double digits, and that's also helping. So we already become the size of a Fortune 100 company. We set a goal for ourselves to double what we did in fiscal '16 and the trajectory is actually quite positive.

I wanted to try to push a little bit more on the mix. Could you comment whether the 8 Plus outsold the 8 in the quarter? There seems to be some data that suggests that. And the 451 Research survey that you're alluding to also finds that over the next 90 days, those buying an iPhone, 43% are planning on buying the X. Could you comment upon your expectations in terms of the mix going forward? And if you won't do that, perhaps you could comment a bit about you're thinking in terms of pushing price elasticity. I think a couple of years ago, no one would have imagined selling a phone at this price.",".

Q: Could you comment upon your expectations in terms of the mix going forward?
A: We expect the mix to continue to shift towards the iPhone X as we see more people upgrading to the latest iPhone.

Q: And if you won't do that, perhaps you could comment a bit about you're thinking in terms of pushing price elasticity.
A: We are continuing to invest in new product lines and features that make the iPhone more valuable to customers. We believe that the value of the iPhone is increasing and that customers are increasingly willing to pay for the best phone in the market."

Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [18]
                                        
Obviously, I'm not going to talk about mix. It's not something that we've done in the past. If you look at the 8 and 8 Plus, when we launched them, they instantly became our top 2 selling products. If you look at 8 Plus in particular, to provide a little color there, 8 Plus for that   for the period of time that we can measure to date, has gotten off to the fastest start of any Plus model. That, for us, was a bit of a surprise, and it's a positive surprise, obviously. And so we'll see what happens next.",".

Q: What do you think is driving the fast start for 8 Plus?
A: The fast start for 8 Plus is likely due to its premium features and design."
Edited version Q4 2017 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Apple Inc Earnings Call: As I've mentioned before, we've never had 3 products, and it's only today that the first customers can certainly look at all 3 of those. And I'm sure there's been some people that wanted to do that before deciding even which one. And so we'll see what happens there. But in terms of price elasticity, I think it's important to remember that a large number of people pay for the phone by month. And so if you were to go out on the   just the U.S., since that tends to be more the focus of this call. If you look at the U.S. carriers, I think you would find   you could buy an iPhone X for $33 a month. And so if you think about that, that's a few coffees a week.",".

What is the price elasticity of iPhone X sales? 
The price elasticity of iPhone X sales is high."
Edited version Q4 2017 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Apple Inc Earnings Call: It's less than a coffee a day at one of these nice coffee places.  The other thing to keep in mind is that many people are now trading in their current iPhone on the next iPhone. And the residual value for iPhone tends to be the highest in the industry and many people pick up $300, $350 or so for their iPhone. And so that even reduces the monthly payment less. And then, obviously some carriers also have promotional things going on. And so I do think it's important to try to place it in that context. In terms of the way we price, we price to the sort of the value that we're providing. We're not trying to charge the highest price we could get or anything like that. We're just trying to price it for what we're delivering.",".

Toni, I'll take that one. When   you said, we price our products for the value that we deliver.  We also said that every time we launch new products, the cost structures of the new products tend to be higher than the products that they replace. It's inevitable. We are adding new technologies, new features. And therefore, the cost structures go up.",".

Question: Why do you think the cost structures of new products tend to be higher than the products that they replace? 
Answer: We add new technologies, new features which drives up the cost structures."
Edited version Q4 2017 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Apple Inc Earnings Call: We have a very good track record of taking those cost structures and, over the life cycle of the product, we are able to bring them down. There are a lot of elements in the gross margin line that we have good control over and we   there are also elements that we don't control. Take for example, foreign exchange, which has been a significant headwind for the company for the last 3 years now. Also, the mix of products that we sell into the market tends to change over time. And that also has an impact on the overall gross margin for the company. There are situations where the commodities markets are in good shape. There are situations where commodity markets can be a bit out of balance.",".

Question: What is the impact of foreign exchange on gross margin?
Answer: Foreign exchange has a significant impact on gross margin because it affects the cost of goods sold. When the value of the currency changes, it impacts the cost of goods sold and the company's margins."
Edited version Q4 2017 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Apple Inc Earnings Call: We have a case right now around memory pricing, which is a headwind for the time being. So there's many puts and takes. The fact that our Services business is growing should be a positive because our services margins tend to be accretive to company margin. So there's many puts and takes that we tend to think about maximizing gross margin dollars. And   because we think that's the most important thing for investors at the end of the day.  When we look at our track record over years, I think we found a good balance between unit growth and gross margins and revenue, and we will continue to do that as we go forward.                                         
A.M. Sacconaghi,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [24]
                                        
Okay. And then, I wanted to revisit this notion of supply and demand."," that relates to that.

What is one put and take that Apple thinks about when it comes to maximizing gross margin dollars?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Apple Inc Earnings Call: And I realize it's very early and you can't make predictions. I think, a common investor question is the iPhone X was made available for sale; it quickly had pushed out availability levels to unprecedented levels versus history. And so I think the really significant question is, is that initial pushout really a function of uniquely strong demand versus history? Or is that pushout in availability really a function of much weaker supply versus history? So it would be really helpful.  You have in the past commented on first 24-hour orders for which there were 4 million-plus for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. You have, very often on this call, talked about targeting when you think you could reach supply-demand balance.","

The bandwidth issue has also been an issue, but as you point out, it is being addressed. And between the large carriers there with Bharti and now Jio investing the way they are, the service in India is materially better than it was just 12 months ago.

Yes, Amit. So we're guiding 38% to 38.5%. That's up 35 bps sequentially. Obviously, we're getting the leverage from the larger volumes. As I mentioned, I think, to Toni, we have higher cost structures every time we launch new products. So that is going to be the offset.

Got it. That's really helpful. And I guess, if I could just follow up on the services line. You just talked about it a fair amount earlier, but even if I exclude the onetime gain, it looks like the back half of '17 accelerated by 500 basis points in fiscal '17 versus the first half of '17. Qualitatively or quantitatively, is there a way to think about how much of this is from expanding the installed base, which is 1 of the 3 things you mentioned, I think, versus more dollar per iOS device that you're seeing?                                         
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [33]

Edited version Q4 2017 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Apple Inc Earnings Call: As I mentioned, particularly on the App Store, which is very important to us, the number of paying accounts has grown a lot. It's grown a lot because, as you said, the installed base has grown, but also because we have made a number of changes that have made it easier for our customers around the world to participate on the App Store and be able to transact on the Apps Store. We are accepting, for example, more forms of payment today than we were 12 months ago or even 6 months ago. So that's been very important. We also see that there is a typical spending curve for our customers when they start transacting on the store.","

What are some of the changes that Apple has made to make it easier for customers to participate on the App Store?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Apple Inc Earnings Call: They start at a certain level and they tend, over time, to get more familiar with the store and they start to spend more. We're also now very recently made some changes, as you probably have seen, to the design of the App Store. And I was mentioning during the prepared remarks that these changes have been received very favorably. And so, people now are spending more time on the store, they download more apps and then, over time, translates into monetization. But we also have other businesses that are growing very, very fast and actually accelerating. I mentioned Music; I mentioned iCloud. And so it all adds up. And as you correctly point out, our growth rate is accelerating.

Kathryn Lynn Huberty, Morgan Stanley - Moderator: Okay, thank you. And then Tim, I wanted to ask you about iPhone sales. You said that March quarter guidance assumes a slower average weekly growth in total revenue as well as, I think, on my math, iPhone shipments when you compare it to the December quarter. Can you tell us more about what you mean by slower average weekly growth?

Tim Cook, Apple Inc. - CEO: Yeah. So, I mean, obviously, we don't want to give away too much detail about our product pipeline, but we do see some slowdown in average weekly growth in total revenue. And that's primarily driven by a slowdown in iPhone sales. But we also see some slowdown in average weekly growth in other products as well.

Kathryn Lynn Huberty, Morgan Stanley - Moderator: Okay. And then last question, Luca. Can you tell us about the impact that you're seeing from the lower-priced battery replacements or anything else in the market?

Luca Maestri, Apple Inc. - CFO: So we're seeing some impact from the lower-priced battery replacements. But we don't have any specific data on that yet. We're still trying to understand the magnitude of that impact.

Kathryn Lynn Huberty, Morgan Stanley - Moderator: Okay. And"

What is the company's guidance for the second quarter?

The company is guiding to $60 billion to $62 billion in revenue."
Edited version Q1 2018 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Apple Inc Earnings Call: <Sync id=""L213""time=""00:34:06""/>And maybe the 2 most important messages are that we believe iPhone revenue will grow double digits as compared to last year during the March quarter, and also and importantly, that iPhone sell-through growth on a year-over-year basis will be actually accelerating during the March quarter as compared to the December quarter. <Sync id=""L214""time=""00:34:31""/>Let me explain the factors that we took into consideration as we came up with our iPhone units and ASP that are embedded in our guidance. <Sync id=""L215""time=""00:34:43""/>Historically, because of the channel fill and the holiday season, our sell-in volume during the December quarter is generally higher than sell-through. <Sync id=""L216""time=""00:34:54""/>This year, the difference was further magnified because we shipped iPhone X in November rather than the September quarter. <Sync id=""L217""time=""00:35:04""/>We had a very successful product ramp.",".

Edited version Q1 2018 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Apple Inc Earnings Call: <Sync id=""L218""time=""00:35:07""/>We were able to reach supply-demand balance in December, which placed the entirety of our channel fill for iPhone X in Q1. <Sync id=""L219""time=""00:35:16""/>And this will have an effect on both units and ASP in Q2. <Sync id=""L220""time=""00:35:21""/>Now for units, there is a second point to consider. <Sync id=""L221""time=""00:35:24""/>We typically reduce channel inventory for our newest iPhones in Q2 because they enjoy very large demand in the initial weeks of sales, which are compounded by the holiday season in Q1. <Sync id=""L222""time=""00:35:38""/>So we anticipate doing that in Q2 this year as well. <Sync id=""L223""time=""00:35:42""/>For ASPs, there's also another element that we need to consider. <Sync id=""L224""time=""00:35:46""/>As you know, our newest products this year have higher ASPs than they had in the past.",".

Question: What is the second point to consider for units?

Answer: We typically reduce channel inventory for our newest iPhones in Q2 because they enjoy very large demand in the initial weeks of sales, which are compounded by the holiday season in Q1."
Edited version Q1 2018 Apple Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Apple Inc Earnings Call: <Sync id=""L225""time=""00:35:52""/>And so as a result, as we reduce inventories of these newest products, the overall ASPs for iPhone in Q2 will naturally decline sequentially by a higher percentage than we have experienced historically. <Sync id=""L226""time=""00:36:07""/>So in summary, our guidance for iPhone, we got double-digit year-over-year growth and acceleration of sell-through growth on a year-over-year basis. <Sync id=""L227""time=""00:36:21""/>For the balance of the company, in the aggregate, we expect to grow strong double digits year-over-year and particularly very strong performance in service and in wearables like we've seen during the December quarter. <Sync id=""L228""time=""00:36:34""/>I hope this helps.

                                                   Thanks for taking my question. I guess this is one of the most exciting developments that we've heard about in awhile, the license agreement.",".

What is the value of the agreement?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: And I was hoping that you could maybe provide some more color on that.
Could you help us understand, maybe just go back in time and just explain the cross-license agreement that you have with Intel? What should investors understand about that and assessing any kind of a risk associated with this IP agreement? Do you need to get   do you check in   do you tell Intel that this is going on, did you get clearance from them, or is this something that you just kind of run with?
And when do you   do you have to wait for like regulatory approval to get this through? Or   how should we think about timing and milestones? That is a lot of questions. I will stop there. Thank you.                                         
Lisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [3]
                                                   Okay, Mark.",".

Question: What should investors understand about the cross-license agreement between AMD and Intel?
Answer: The agreement allows AMD to use Intel's intellectual property in products. It is important to note that this does not mean that AMD is beholden to Intel, as AMD retains the right to develop its own products."
Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: This is Lisa. Thank you for your question. Regarding the JV that we just announced, yes, we are very excited about it, partnering with THATIC, and really focusing on the Chinese market for server processors.
What we are licensing in this agreement is microprocessor technologies and system-on-chip technologies, all of the technologies, licensed our AMD technologies. So there are no encumbrances from that standpoint.
We have closed on the deal and we are starting execution of the deal. So we've talked about, from a financial standpoint, there is a $293 million licensing payment over a number of years.",".

Question: What is the total value of the agreement?
Answer: The total value of the agreement is $293 million."
Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: What we expect is the first payment we received in the first quarter of $50 million-ish, and we expect that over the first two years that about half of the licensing payments would be paid upon completion of some development milestones.
So overall for us, I've talked about IP monetization in a very broad sense. For us, that includes patents as well as technology licensing. This one is very positive for us, not just from the standpoint that it leverages our IP, but it also gives us a very key partner in the Chinese market, which we all believe is going to be very, very important for data center growth going forward. So hopefully I addressed your questions there.

                                                   Could you give us some idea? You called out your sequential growth guidance was in part due to graphics. Are you able to give us any feel for what sequential growth in graphics your guidance assumes?
And what products are driving the sequential growth? Does this come from Polaris? Or do Polaris revenues start after the June quarter?                                         
Lisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [9]
                                                   Yes. So David, our sequential guidance, as we mentioned, is due to both semi-custom and graphics. I would say it is more heavily weighted on semi-custom.
But if you look at our graphics progression over the last couple of quarters, even though Q1 is normally a weaker market than Q4, we grew units overall in the desktop graphics business.",".

What products are driving the sequential growth? Does this come from Polaris? Or do Polaris revenues start after the June quarter?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So we believe that was on some of the strength of some of our new software work and our work with the ecosystem.
So going into the second quarter, again, we believe that we have an opportunity in graphics to drive some volume. Polaris is on track to launch in the middle of the year and we will expect that will drive   further strengthen the second half.

                                                   Okay, great. And just a clarification. You mentioned $53 million license gain, but if I understand correctly, your guidance is for $25 million in the second quarter. Is that part of that $53 million? Or is that something different?

In terms of foundries, I think we are not ready to talk about foundries. But we will update more about the products as we get further into the execution.

We have the growth with our guidance for revenue in Q2, and it is weighted towards the semi-custom business in addition to the growth that we are seeing in graphics.",".

Question: What is the mix of business between the semi-custom business and the EESC business? 
Answer: The mix of business between the semi-custom business and the EESC business is a big factor in gross margin."

And then as far as the levels going on from there, I think it partly is a mix of the business overall from a viewpoint of the semi-custom business and other businesses. But also the continuing investment we are making in the roadmaps, as you see from our OpEx guidance for the rest of the year, as we want to go ahead and invest in products, in graphics, and other areas that will help us improve the gross margin. And then getting into later on when the Zen product is introduced, having even higher gross margin compared to where we are today.

Going into the second quarter in general, it depends on the mix and the mix of the product. We are certainly trying to sell further up the stack. But we will have to see how the exact mix comes out. But there is not a dramatic change in ASPs, if that is what you're asking.

                                                   Yes. So again, on the PC market, I think our view of the PC market is very consistent with what's out there, probably down, let's call it, high-single digits. Certainly the first quarter started off a bit weaker than any of us would have liked.
I would say, though, that in that environment, we still believe that we can gain share in both the client compute and the graphics side.",".

What is AMD's expectation for its growth in the PC market this year?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Really, as we are transitioning to a new product portfolio on the graphics side, so I think that is a strong driver for us.
And then on the client compute side, between our product refresh and also our partnership with OEMs. I think in general, OEMs are getting more comfortable using us higher up in the stack, and our A8s, our A10s, our commercial-based processors. So we are continuing to work with OEMs to ensure that we get into the right priority platforms. So that would be our focus, even in a down market.

The IP monetization includes patent licensing. It includes sales of certain parts of our patent portfolio that are no longer core to our business, as well as the strategic technology licensing.

Just to be clear, do you expect to game console revenue specifically to be up? And kind of related to that, do you expect the C&G revenue to be up this year as well?

It is up slightly in Q1, but we also guided the revenue up pretty significantly from where we ended in Q1. And we have also said the second half of the year, we are expecting strength over first half, and obviously that leads to higher inventory.
So Q1 to Q2, up slightly; revenues up. And then we expect second half to be stronger than the first half.

How do you split it up between gaming and the new VR strategy, VR market? Obviously, VR seems to be a huge market as you look out. Thanks.                                         
Lisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [87]
                                                   Yes, I think the way to think about it is for the near term, I think the semi-custom business and gaming is probably the larger driver. We believe VR is a strategic area where you will see more pickup over the next number of quarters and over the next years. But it is not the near-term driver.

                                                   Lisa, I guess my first question   when you look at your full-year guide for revenue to grow, I am kind of curious to what extent is that based upon sort of market forecast versus market share gains.
I know you don't want to get into division by division, but maybe at a high level, as you look at your year-over-year growth, how do you differentiate between what the market is doing and kind of the market share gains that you need to get to that year-over-year growth?                                         
Lisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [91]
                                                   Yes, that is a fair question. So let me break it up into the two segments.",.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: When you look at the EESC segment and especially semi-custom, that is less about a general market and more about what we see in terms of the customer forecasts, and what they are seeing the market to be. So I think those are, let's call it, fairly well understood by us, and we are very interlocked with our customers.
When you talk about the computing and graphics market, I think that is where you get a little bit more of how much uncertainty is there with the PC market trends.","

What is your outlook for the computing and graphics market?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: There is no question that the PC market is weaker than any of us would like.
I think from our standpoint, though, if you remember the last few quarters and how many times we've talked about inventory normalization and ensuring that we got ourselves into a healthy position relative to our OEM and channel customers, I think we feel that we've done a good job there. And we are now in a place where the consumption is more in line with the selling.
So we believe that even in this market, there is enough opportunity for us to gain share, and obviously we have to prove that out over the next couple of quarters.",".

Question: What do you think is the biggest challenge facing the PC market?
Answer: The PC market is weaker than any of us would like.

                                                   And then Lisa, I apologize if you addressed this, but just going back to the JV in China, I am just kind of curious.",".

What is the JV in China?

The JV in China is a joint venture between AMD and Chinese chipmaker Spreadtrum."
Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: The IP licensing gains you expected this year, are there any milestones that you need to hit to get that? And as we think about 2017, if you hit the milestones in 2017, would we expect licensing to grow year over year from the JV?
And then lastly on the JV, just given that you guys have the opportunity to go into China today and sell your own product, I am just curious how we should think about $100 of server product in the JV and what that means to you from an economic standpoint versus you just going into China today and selling $100 worth of server product as AMD.                                         
Lisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [93]
                                                   Yes, no, good question.",".

Q: What milestones do you need to hit in order to receive IP licensing gains this year?
A: We need to hit certain milestones in order to receive IP licensing gains this year."
Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So look, on the JV licensing payments, we will expect about half of the licensing revenue to come over the next two years, so over 2016 and 2017. Our current forecast for 2016 was that $50-ish million that Devinder mentioned, and it is contingent on several milestones that we believe are on track.
To your broader question about why do a JV versus just selling right into servers? We are very cognizant of where our share is in servers. So I believe we have the technology to get there and we will continue to make progress.
But given the importance of China and the fact that having a partner who is very much familiar with both the Chinese market from a customer as well as just a technology standpoint I think can only be additive.",".

What are the milestones that are necessary for the $50 million in licensing revenue to be realized?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: And there is more than enough server market to go after, given where we are. So I think it's an additive deal to our baseline strategy.

                                                   Lisa, for the semi-custom wins that you are going to get in the back half of the year, are those going to be purely incremental to existing products? Or is there any risk of cannibalization to existing products?                                         
Lisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [97]
                                                   I don't believe that we have gone through any detail about what those wins are, so I would prefer to let that come out as our customers are ready to launch.                                         
Deepon Nag,  Macquarie Research - Analyst    [98]

What is Lisa Su's response to cannibalization concerns for semi-custom wins in the back half of the year?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: And then on the game console side, so clearly VR is going to be a pretty big deal in Q4 with so many PS4 VR. And there has been some chatter about obviously maybe a thatcher refresh for some of the game consuls.
Because the value of graphics is becoming higher in these game consoles, is there any potential for you to get higher content, and more specifically higher margins in future console refreshes? And is there also any ability to renegotiate terms if   because of the value of your IP is getting more valuable inside these consoles?                                         
Lisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [99]
                                                   Let me take that in several pieces. Relative to our current game consoles, those deals were well negotiated at the beginning, and I don't think we will be renegotiating.",".

Question: Will you renegotiate your game console deals if they become more valuable?
Answer: No, we will not renegotiate our game console deals if they become more valuable."
Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: I think the ASPs and all that stuff are also well understood.
Relative to what VR brings   and again, not being specific to any particular customer because there is just a lot of speculation out there in the industry   I will say that VR is very exciting, not just for game consoles, but for PC gaming, for the headset guys, for the ecosystem. So yes, we believe that graphics becomes much more valuable in this framework, and we will be looking for how to leverage and monetize that across both our semi-custom business as well as our discrete graphics and APU businesses.                                         
Deepon Nag,  Macquarie Research - Analyst    [100]

What is the company's strategy for leveraging VR technology?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So if   for any future console refreshes, though, you do have the ability to reset ASP trends?

Lisa Su,  AMD - President and CEO    [101]
                                                   I think if anybody were to do a different console or a new console, then that would be a new negotiation. But for the current generation consoles, those terms are locked.

                                                   Thanks for taking the question. Just on the Polaris launch in midyear, you talked about attacking the mainstream segment of the GPU market."," that would help clarify that strategy.

Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: I just wonder when you look at potential share gains in the second half, do you expect that to come more from the discrete desktop side in the AIB channel or the notebook space where you have a relatively higher share, market share?
And given your ASPs in that space, roughly in the discrete desktop spaces, I think you've got about a third of the ASP of your competitor. Just wondering on the trend of that and how you see that over the second half of the year.

                                                   Yes, so we believe that we have a share gain opportunity in both mobile and desktop/AIB as we look at Polaris and how it will launch in the second half of the year.",.

Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Relative to the ASP trends, I think that depends a bit on the mix of the business. So I think I will defer that to how things look.
But from a macro standpoint, we believe we can get a larger share   a larger revenue share in discrete graphics. But we will certainly have to look at how the individual quarters shape up.

                                                   In terms of your first question on GPU acceleration, so the JV that we announced with THATIC is focused on microprocessor technologies only, so it does not cover graphics.
And then to your comment about graphics acceleration or just in general becoming more important and a growth driver, we would agree with that. I think going forward, you will see a bit more focus from us in that area.",".

                                                   One question on gross margin. I noticed that you are not providing gross margin guidance for 2016 and I was wondering if you have clarity that your revenue would be up year on year. What are some of the puts and takes here that's making you hold gross margin guidance?                                         
Devinder Kumar,  AMD - SVP, CFO, Treasurer    [15]
                                                   I think the key is if you look back over the last few quarters, we have made progress on the gross margin front, ending Q4 2015 at a 30% level. And the guidance specifically for Q1 of 2016 is 32%.
You're right   I haven't given guidance for the year.",".

1. What are some of the puts and takes here that's making you hold gross margin guidance? 
2. What are your expectations for revenue in 2016?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: But some of the puts and takes are really the mix of product as we get more into 2016. And then obviously the mix of business between our computing and graphics segment and the EESC segment.
In computing and graphics, we have introduced some new products in the second half of 2015 and even going into 2016 and you have some of the commercial success we've had. And that obviously has gross margin, but at the same time, we want to see how the year unfolds, in particular on the PC side of the house, given some of the comments we made about caution in China in particular.
So for the year, I'm not giving guidance today.","

You indicated you are shipping your Seattle, but at the same time in your guidance, you didn't mention anything about ARM contributing in 2016. And my question is, is ARM servers a meaningful share for you in 2017 and 2018?

Question: What is AMD's share of ARM servers in 2017 and 2018? Answer: AMD's share of ARM servers in 2017 and 2018 is not yet known."
Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: I think we have some design wins with it and I would call it a modest revenue contributor in 2016.
We still see ARM strategically as a interesting market for the infrastructure markets, but it is certainly developing a bit slower than expected. So I think overall I think it's an important proof point in terms of enterprise class server architectures with ARM, but it's a modest revenue contribution in 2016.

                                                   I think it's more of a market statement, Vivek, than an AMD-specific statement. I think the overall commentary   maybe if I just expand a little bit   is the data center market is really, really interesting. And I think we all agree with that. I think x86 has a lot of momentum and that's one of the reasons that we've put quite a bit more emphasis on our x86 data center and infrastructure play.
Now that being said, I think ARM does have a lot of specific areas where it can contribute and it has done so.",".

And as I follow up perhaps a longer-term question, which is what is the strategy to actually get to a meaningful earnings and cash flow growth? I understand the macro environment is a little tough right now, but the way I see it, a lot of the progress you guys are making on your embedded products is being offset by the declines in your legacy businesses.
And as the mix is shifting to your embedded products, gross margins are sort of holding around that 30% level, but you're not really able to reduce cost.",".

What are the main reasons for AMD's lack of sustained profitability?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So I think what you have to do is take a step back and look at overall, the progress in year 2015 from a foundation standpoint and then what we hope to accomplish in 2016 and forward.

And then as we go forward, we have our data center strategy as well as our semi-custom and new markets that will bring additional opportunities.
So from a product standpoint, it is about getting our technology out there and I think we will enter 2016 with the strongest product portfolio we've had in a long time.",".

                                                   If I can add, Lisa, I think the other thing I would add is if you look at a couple of areas that Lisa mentioned   data center in particular, but also the embedded space. As we talked about in our financial analyst day in May, those are businesses that command higher gross margins.
So, Vivek, to your point about the gross margins, I think longer term with that business kicking in in 2017, we believe that we can get closer to the longer-term model. 2016 we've guided to operating   free cash flow positive from an operation standpoint.",".

Especially since it looks like Zen isn't really launching until the tail end of the year and it looks like you're starting Q1 already in the hole if I compare your guidance versus Intel.

Q1 2016 guidance is lower than what we had previously guided due to the delay in Zen and the impact of currency. We are still targeting mid-single digit share gains in PC market.

Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So overall if you look at PCs, I think we'll have to wait until the numbers come out, but we believe we have gained a bit of share in Q4.
I think if you look at the driving factors behind that, Stacy, there were a couple factors. In 2015, I think we did a concerted effort to clean up some of our channel inventory, both on the OEM side as well as in the DIY channel. So that factor will be gone in 2015 relative to 2016.
I think if you look at the product roadmap, I think the product roadmap is stronger. I think if you look at our commercial business, that is also stronger.","

What factors led to AMD's gain in share in Q4?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So it's leading to a stronger product mix, so those are the key factors.
Relative to the Q1 guidance   I'll make a comment about Q1 guidance overall. Our Q1 guidance includes obviously both the computing and graphics and the enterprise embedded and semi-custom business. The semi-custom business is historically significantly lower in the first quarter of the year. If you look at the past couple of years it's been the case because they are coming off of a strong holiday season. So I would say that has to be factored into the guidance.
And then if you look at the computing and graphics business, I think what we're seeing is very consistent with what's out there in the market. And we believe in that market   that set of market conditions we can gain share.",".

I think the thing to bear in mind   I think I said in my prepared remarks in our quarter this year, actually both from a viewpoint of the quarter and the year, we have a 53-week year and we have a 13-week quarter in Q1.  As opposed to what the competitors and you are doing, I think it's more on the 14 weeks as opposed to 13 weeks.

Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: In terms of my follow-up, just very briefly, does your guidance for positive free cash flow for the year include the proceeds from the backend sale?

I guess relative to some lower operating spending that you guys are doing as a Company, maybe Lisa, you could lay out some priorities for how you are going to roll out these products? I guess particularly I'm looking at how you balance semi-custom versus discrete GPU? How you balance enterprise GPUs versus APUs when you roll out Zen.

I will say that I am pleased with the execution on engineering that we have accomplished over the last 12 months. I think we have passed some significant hurdles. The transition to FinFET for us was very, very critical across our businesses and I feel good about the state of the progress there.
As it reflects on 2016 spending, I think Devinder commented earlier, but I would say that's why we're giving ourselves a range in the OpEx from $320 million to $340 million. And we are being prudent in where we spend. However, clearly there is a significant focus on discrete graphics and what we can do in that space.

I think relative to our CPU competitiveness and retaining competitiveness there, that is a very key priority as well. So Zen across both our client computing as well as our server markets are a priority.
Relative   the good thing about our semi-custom business is it does rely on customer investment to customize the roadmap. So I think the combination of those things gives us a reasonable envelope to execute the go-to-market around the product portfolio.

If I start from down 14%, I think, you have to model double-digit for the next three quarters, which is well above seasonal for you. So I'm trying to understand where the growth is coming from.
Obviously you said you expect to gain share, but can you talk about the semi-custom win that's supposed to ramp in the second half, how big that opportunity is, and when exactly you expect those ramps to come in?

Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So if you look overall at our business   yes, we are projecting full-year revenue growth 2016 compared to 2015 and so we would have to have some significant growth as we go into the second half of the year.
Independent of any new designs, the semi-custom business naturally is significantly higher in the second half than in the first half; especially third quarter. It's kind of a peak for the business as we go into the holiday season and we continue to see that phenomenon as our customers are giving us their forecast.
We expect the base semi-custom business or the base game consoles to continue unit growth in 2016 versus 2015.",".

Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: There will be some modest ASP decline with that, and then we expect to layer over it some new semi-custom revenue starting in the second half of the year.
So from what we see, obviously a lot of things have to happen, but the semi-custom business is one that we've been able to predict pretty well, given the customer long-term forecasts. And then we have to continue the conversation around the computing and graphics business as we see how the market sorts itself out in the first half of the year going into the stronger second half for the PC business.

I think we have had really a good discussion around where to go there. I think there are several different avenues that we believe our IP will be valuable.

What is the company's strategy for generating revenue from its embedded and semi-custom business?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: You talked about the gaming SoC business being up on a unit basis, but in 2015, that whole segment was down about 8% year over year.
So I guess my question is I know new things are coming in in the back half of this year, but what gives you confidence that today's core business can actually remain anywhere close to flat considering that it fell in 2015?                                         
Lisa Su,  AMD - President, CEO    [53]
                                                   Yes, Ross. So let me give you some more color on the compare, which might help. So on the base EESC business, if you were to look at product revenues of semi-custom game console SoCs, they were actually up a bit. So overall, units were up double-digit percentage. ASP declined, but less than that.",".

What gives you confidence that today's core business can actually remain anywhere close to flat considering that it fell in 2015?

We are confident in our core business because we see continued growth in the gaming SoC market. Gaming is a growing market and we see continued demand for our products."
Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So product revenue was up.
What you saw as segment decline was actually legacy revenue from server and embedded. And if you remember, we have some legacy revenue based on some of the older updrawn products that we continue to sell. And that has seen a drop off as well as our DCSS or C Micro business was there in 2014 that we exited in 2015. So that was the year-on-year decline that was there.
And then I think as you go forward to 2016   I'm not being that specific about the base business, but I will say I think units will be up. And we will have to see exactly how much up and as the markets go, but we certainly don't see it substantially down, if that's what you're implying.",".

                                                   That's very helpful. And I guess piggybacking off that to an earlier question   this time for Devinder on the gross margin side. Correct me if from wrong here, but what I heard as to the answer to the earlier question as to why you're not guiding for the full-year gross margin was partially because the unknown mix dynamic in revenues.
To the extent that's true, does that imply that the gross margin delta between the computing and graphics group and the EESC group, even with the new ramps in semi-custom, is likely to remain as wide as it has in the last year or so?                                         
Devinder Kumar,  AMD - SVP, CFO, Treasurer    [55]
                                                   I think we have to see how the year unfolds, to be honest.",".

What is the mix dynamic in revenues between the computing and graphics group and the EESC group?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: I think Q1, like I said, the guidance at 32%. We need to see mix of product. We have new products being introduced in both the businesses with the new design wins in the second half on the semi-custom side. And then obviously on the CG side, you've heard us talk about graphics and computing new products kicking in.
So from my standpoint, I want to see how it unfolds in terms of the mix of product, mix of the business before getting into the gross margin. But fair to say, as you know, the semi-custom business   just the way the model works on an NRE standpoint has lower gross margin than the computing and graphics side of the business, so that's a fair statement.

                                                   Thanks for the question. On the semi-custom business, I'm sure you guys have looked at prior console platform price cuts for customers and their effect on sellthrough. So I'd love to know how you are kind of thinking about that and the potential re-acceleration if that were to happen. Do you have any prior metrics you can share with us?
And then also, I think I know the answer, but if there was a platform price cut, should we still expect to slow in linear reduction in your ASPs or might there be something a little bit more aggressive, like a one-time step down?

Question: How do you think about the potential for a console platform price cut from Microsoft?
Answer: If a console platform price cut were to happen, we would expect to see an increase in sellthrough as customers look to save money."
Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So Chris, if you look at the semi-custom cycle   and again, these cycles are hard to predict   through this year, through the end of 2015, the game console units are far ahead of the previous cycle. So on the order of 20 million units ahead of the previous cycle.
When you look at the significant price points, I would say there are sub-$300 price points that start accelerating demand. And you saw some of that this holiday season, so that had some impact.
Your question overall in terms of acceleration   I think, again, the game console guys know how to do this cost reduction and they've done it very well. Our price or ASP reductions are not step-function reductions. They end up being pre-negotiated and in line with cost reductions that we have agreed to with our partners.",".

                                                   Okay. Very helpful. Also, perhaps you can talk about ASPs in 2016, how do you see them trending with Summit Ridge and server products. And how big a driver is that for top line and for profitability?

                                                   I think it is very important that we see an improvement in our product mix. And that's something that we've certainly been striving for in both our mobile products and as we introduce higher-performance desktop and server products we should see that reflected in the ASPs.

And how does that compare relative to the OpEx run rate that Devinder guided for for this year   is that the right quarterly run rate for [that consisting] that type of graphics roadmap, first of all?

Question: How does this one-year-plus cadence for your GPU roadmap compare to the OpEx run rate that Devinder guided for for this year?
Answer: The one-year-plus cadence for our GPU roadmap is in line with our expectations for OpEx spending for this year."
Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So I think the overall answer is we do believe the cadence of graphics requires annual refreshes, and we're going to invest to enable that. And I think the Polaris launch is significant because it's also a change of process technology, which sometimes can run into other issues. But I think we feel very good about where we are there and you should expect that cadence to continue.

                                                   So I really view the macro has more of a headwind for the overall PC market.",".

David Wong: So, Ruth, you mentioned that you're expecting more products to come in the third quarter. Can you give us a little bit more color on what those products might be? 
Ruth Cotter: Sure. So, we launched our new Ryzen processors in the second quarter and we're really excited about them. We also launched a new graphics card, the Radeon RX 480, which is a really powerful card. And we're expecting to launch a new notebook in the third quarter as well. So, we have a lot of exciting products coming in the third quarter and we're really looking forward to seeing how they perform."

My first question   can you give us any detail on the ramp in dollar terms of revenues from new semicustom products in the September/December quarters, and what the seasonal pattern of these products might be?                                         
Lisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [3]
                                        
Sure, David. This is Lisa. Let me start with that. So, our semicustom business overall, we see as strong for the year. I think the predominant business is the current generation game consoles, and as they ramp into the second half and the stronger holiday season.
We expect the seasonality of semicustoms to be similar to prior years.",".

What is the predominant business for semicustom products in the current quarter?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: We'll see a peak in the third quarter and a decline in the fourth quarter, and we will see the new business layer in starting in the third quarter. But I don't expect that to change the seasonality pattern. So, we are building up for a strong holiday season overall.                                         
David Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [4]
                                        
Okay. Great. Thanks, Lisa. And since the launch of your Radeon 480 graphics product end of last month, have you been able to supply to demand for the cards? Or if not, when do you expect demand will rise to match supply?                                         
Lisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [5]
                                        
Yes. So, David, we're very pleased with the launch of the Radeon RX 480. We had good supply at major retailers on launch day.",".

Question: What is the company's forecast for demand for the Radeon RX 480 graphics card?
Answer: We are seeing good demand for the Radeon RX 480 graphics card. We are building up for a strong holiday season overall."
Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Since then, the demand has continued to be strong and so some of the retailers are out of supply. We do see that the 14 LPP yields are good and we're ramping up production steeply.
So we expect that will equalize as we go through the quarter. We're also very soon going to launch the rest of the Radeon RX family. And so you'll see three products in the third quarter in terms of overall product momentum.

Okay. Great. And I'll follow-up if I may. I was hoping that you could just help me with the accounting of the semicustom design wins. So if I remember properly, there was two that you expect in the back half of this year, and then one   I thought it was the first half of next year.
So Scorpio is one of those three? But that's next year; so that's the one for next year?                                         
Lisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",".

Q: Lisa, can you help me understand the accounting for the semicustom design wins?

Yes, let me help you out with the accounting   I know that we've had several different pieces of information on the semicustom new design wins. So what we said is we'll have a total of three semicustom new design wins that will account for about   let's call it $1.5 billion of revenue approximately over the next three to four years.
We are starting the ramp of new business this coming quarter, this third quarter, and that will be one of the semicustom design wins. Scorpio is also a design win, and that, as our customer said, will be in 2017. And we'll give you more information about the third one as we have more visibility.",".

Question: What is the third semicustom new design win?
Answer: The third semicustom new design win is Scorpio."

Lisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [14]
                                        
Well, we're trying to get out a little bit of the counting game, but I think overall, we're pleased with the semicustom pipeline. I think some of the questions that we've been asked are, do we believe we have design wins outside of game consoles, and the answer is yes. We have design wins outside of game consoles. I think we view the pipeline as good, and it's a business model that works well with our high-performance technology plans and our SoC capabilities.

Thanks for taking my questions. Lisa, I have a couple of questions on Zen. You gave some color in your prepared remarks about server opportunities for Zen starting in the first half of next year. Maybe you could give us a little color on potentially what markets you are going after there, where you see the opportunities?
It seems to me that a lot of different moving parts in the cloud market with open power and ARM, and then custom CPUs from Intel, but a pretty big enterprise space that's x86 captive for you guys to go after.",".

Lisa Su, President and CEO of AMD - ""We are very excited about the opportunities in the server market with Zen. We see a lot of potential there, and we are going to be targeting that market in the first half of next year."""
Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So I would just be interested to see what the strategy is going forward there and where the design wins might come from?                                         
Lisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [19]
                                        
Sure, Matt. So, yes, let me give you a little bit of color how we see it. First of all, look, Zen is a brand-new CPU design and we had very ambitious goals for it. And given where we are today, it's actually coming up very well.
We've demoed both desktop systems, and now we have server systems working in both our labs and our customers' labs. I would say as the progress of Zen is   goes along in terms of validation, the customer interest has increased.",".

What are the goals for Zen?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: And so, while we did close a number of design wins in the second quarter and we have a number more in the pipeline, as we go into the third quarter and more widespread availability.
Our view is, Zen is a general-purpose server architecture that can play in many different places. So you mentioned the cloud. I think that's certainly one target market given the growth there. We also see there are workloads that would be particularly   fit well for sort of the performance areas that we're targeting.","

What is the target market for Zen?
The target market for Zen is general-purpose servers."
Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: I think enterprise is also again very much a target area for Zen.
What we are looking for again is ensuring that we have a very high quality launch, and so we're working very closely with customers to make sure that we run their workloads and demonstrate the performance improvement that we expect. But as I said overall, it's going well, and we continue to work with customers to ensure that they see the benefits of Zen and working with AMD.                                         
Matt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [20]
                                        
Thank you for the color and it's good to hear.",".

What is the target market for Zen?
AMD plans to focus on enterprise customers with Zen processors."
Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: I guess another question on Zen more in the PC market   because I think your prepared remarks focused a bit more on server   but maybe you could give us a little bit of an update in the timing of desktop and notebook potential launches.
It just seems to me going into the holiday season that it's still a little unclear as to where Zen is going to land relative to holiday ramps in the Western market and to Chinese New Year. So any color around that would be really helpful. Thank you.                                         
Lisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [21]
                                        
Yes. No, that's a fair question, Matt. So we have been very focused on the server launch for first half of 2017. Desktop should launch before that.",".

Q: So when do you think desktop will launch?
A: We expect desktop to launch before the first half of 2017."
Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: In terms of true volume availability, I believe it will be in the first quarter of 2017. We may ship some limited volume towards the end of the fourth quarter, based on how bring-up goes and the customer readiness.
But again, if I look overall at what we are trying to do, I think the desktop product is very well-positioned for that high-end desktop segment, that enthusiast segment, in both channel and OEM, which is very much a segment that AMD knows well. And so that's where we would focus   on desktop.
You should expect a notebook version of Zen with integrated graphics in 2017, and that development is going on as well. And so I think it's just a time of a lot of activity around the Zen and the different Zen product families.",".

Question: What is the timeframe for the Zen notebook version with integrated graphics?

Thanks for taking my questions. I was looking at the implied guidance for Q4. You said the   I guess for the full year, up low single digits. So, I mean, call it 3%. But it would imply Q4 down 16%/17% sequentially, and actually down on an absolute basis, lower than I would've thought.",".

Thank you. Our guidance for Q4 is unchanged at low single digits."
Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: I think Q4 also has an extra week in it.
I was wondering if you could give us, I guess, some color on how you see the drivers, I guess, for seasonality going from Q3 to Q4 across both of the businesses, given that, I guess, the trajectory of the different product launches that we have in the back half?

Lisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [27]
                                        
Sure. Stacy, maybe I'll start and see if Devinder would like to add to it. So, look, our   when we started the year, our expectation is that we would grow revenue in 2016 versus 2015, but we were coming off of a very low base in the first quarter.",".

Q: How do you come to that number?
A: We expect to grow revenue in 2016 versus 2015."
Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So we've been pleased with how it played out certainly in our second-quarter revenue and the third quarter revenue guidance.
Overall, the businesses are performing well, so we do expect both Computing and Graphics and EEFC to both grow for the year. I think the semicustom business is the large driver of the fourth quarter in terms of just how we see the overall business playing out. But the Computing and Graphics business is playing out as you might expect.
So the second half should be seasonally higher, certainly with Polaris, and as we launch broader availability across the product line, as well as the seventh generation APUs as they go into back-to-school and holiday. So that's the way we should think about it.                                         
Stacy Rasgon,  Bernstein Research - Analyst    [28]

What is Bernstein Research's estimate for Computing and Graphics' revenue for the year?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: For my follow-up, I just wanted to take a look at your notebook shipments in the quarter. So they were up again sequentially   I think they were up double digits in Q1; I think they were up in Q4 as well. So three quarters in a row of sequential increase. Obviously off a low base as well.
But how confident are you   like what's driving that? Is this   is it actually sort of a sell-out that's actually driving the demand? Or is this sell-in into the channel? And how should we think about that potentially normalizing?                                         
Lisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [29]
                                        
Yes, so if you're talking about the notebook computing business, actually we are kind of pleased with how it performed.",".

1. What was the increase in notebook shipments in the quarter? 
2. What is driving that increase? 
3. Is this a sell-out or is this actually driving demand?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So if you look at it, overall, the   our OEM customers have adopted our technologies, so we see that across both notebook and desktop, but presumably notebook.
We are also making progress in commercial, and that was a very important initiative over the past five or six quarters. And so that's been nice to stabilize the business. And again, I don't believe it's a sell-in phenomenon. Actually it's consumption share that we see increasing. And I think we have a reasonable opportunity to add to that in the second half of the year. But it's really around our products in the platforms that we're putting together with the OEMs.

Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: I was just a little bit surprised at how much your wafer purchases at GlobalFoundries came down quarter-over-quarter, given the increase in notebooks as well as the timing of the Polaris launch.

I think basically the purchases of the wafers are in line with product demand and mix of business. And as I said in the prepared remarks, the other day we purchased about [$260 million] of wafers, and we are getting into the back half of the year, which as you can see, with our revenue guidance in Q3, is pretty strong.

Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Overall, they are a partner.
As it relates to how we think about our IP, we really believe that our IP, particularly the high performance element of it on the microprocessor and the graphic side, is very unique, and in some sense, there are very few places in the industry where you have access to it. I think the applications that need it, whether you are talking about consumer applications or enterprise cloud applications, are growing. And so it's an opportunity for us to look for larger markets to monetize beyond just our own products.
And that's, in general, the way we think about IP monetization. We have a set of products that is very important to our business model, but our IP can go further than our products themselves.",".

Sure. So let me talk about the PC market overall. I think our view of the PC market is pretty similar to others in the industry. We would say, overall for 2016, high-single digit decline. We have seen some positive signals, and we saw some positive data points from IDC earlier the last week.",".

Our view is OEM business looks okay. The channel for us is still weaker than we would like, and that's our view of the PC business. Even in that framework, we believe we can grow our Computing and Graphics business on the strength of the products. The Graphics products, we've talked about, as they ramp in the second half of the year. And on the Computing side as well, I think we have a number of new platforms, and back-to-school and holiday are important for us. So that's the way would characterize PCs.",".

Yes, John, I think the way you think about it is, it is the mix of business, so that's a good observation. But also you see us making continuing investments in our roadmap in graphics and in other areas, and we believe that will help us improve the gross margin.

Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: I mean if you look overall when we have a higher mix of semicustom business, typically the gross margin is lower since the business model on the semicustom side has for the lower margin just the way the model is constructed.

This is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my question. I have a follow-up on your Project Scorpio comment. I think it's going to be launched in 2017. And I think you had significantly higher performance and support 4K and V. So how should we think about the pricing on ASP that compares to what you have indicated on the current generation game console platform?                                         
Lisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [68]
                                        
Yes. So, again we don't   we wouldn't disclose anything that's incrementally more than what our customer has disclosed.",". 

Q: So you're not going to disclose the pricing on ASP for the Scorpio platform?
A: We don't disclose pricing on ASP for the Scorpio platform."
Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So I think Microsoft has talked about their goals with Project Scorpio. I think we are in support of those goals. Given the performance level, you would imagine that there's more capability on chip, but I wouldn't want to go more than that.                                         
Gabriel Ho,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [69]
                                        
Okay. As a follow-up   I think your competitor has launched a comparable mainstream product   I think GeForce 10 6P, so given the absence of your maybe higher performance part launching maybe in the second half, so how should we think about the rest of the year on the demand on your graphics side?                                         
Lisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [70]
                                        
Yes, we are feeling very good about our Polaris launch. This was our strategy from the beginning.",".

Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: I mean we laid out a strategy where we were going after the mainstream, and growth rate, really a new experience in terms of both capability and price point. And I think we've done that.
We've also been very focused on DX 12 and our performance   on new APIs like Vulcan. So we are happy with our competitiveness. I think it's played out as we thought it would do. Certainly our aspirations in GPU are to certainly have very competitive products across the entire product line. And so I've talked about working on Vega, which is the next generation high-end architecture.
But in terms of our competitiveness, you know, we   again, we've executed what we thought we were going to execute. And it seems like, from both customer reviews and analyst reviews, that it's pretty well-received by the market.","

Q: What are your thoughts on the competitive landscape in the graphics market?
A: We're happy with our competitiveness."

Operator, we'll take two more callers, please.

Ian Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [74]
                                        
Yes, thank you for fitting me in. So EESC   looks like you achieved operating income same level as third quarter of last year but with $45 million lower revenue. So just wondering how you got more profitable in this segment, given these are both strong game console quarters and also you've got annual price declines in game consoles, I assume. Thanks.                                         
Devinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",".

Yes, so I think the key to profitability in this segment is really around execution of our product roadmap. We've got a lot of new products coming out this year, both in the high-end desktop space and in the game console space. And we're seeing good uptake of those products. So I think that's really driving our profitability in this segment."
Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [75]
                                        
I think if you look at the profitability, you've got to remember that in the EESC segment, we also have other businesses embedded for one, and also the investment we are making for the enterprise side of it, for the data center product that's coming out in 2017. So the profitability   you're right about the observation, but profitability depends upon obviously   the largest business we have in there right now is the semicustom business, but also the investments on the OpEx standpoint that we make year-on-year. And we talked about the targeted investments we are making in some of the product areas.                                         
Ian Ing,  MKM Partners - Analyst    [76]
                                        
Okay. Great. But these are relatively older products that are embedded into enterprise products at the moment then, it sounds like. Okay, great.",".

What are the targeted investments that AMD is making in 2017?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: And then my follow-on is   you are at a one-year cadence for GPUs now. Could you talk about expectations on how last year's R9300 series winds down and how that plays out? It looks like in Q2, it was really just a lack of a pause ahead of a known refresh. And do you expect sort of a sharp wind-down at some point? Or is it more gradual?                                         
Lisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [77]
                                        
Actually, Ian, that's a good observation. The 390 series or the 300 series overall actually did do okay in the second quarter. We were also wondering whether there would be a pause prior to a new generation.",".

Q: So you're not seeing a pause in the production of GPUs? 
A: We're not seeing a pause in the production of GPUs."
Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: I think we see it as a very orderly transition; it's actually one of our better product transitions as we go from the 300 series over to the 400 series.
So again, nothing very spectacular to report other than the sellthrough has continued   the sellthrough was good in the second quarter. And we believe that it's an orderly transition of the inventory.

Operator    [80]
                                        
Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Jaguar Bajwa from Arete Research. Please proceed with your question.                                         
Jaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [81]
                                        
Thanks for taking my question. Just a question on Q3.",". 

What guidance did you give for Q3 product sales?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Could you just lay out which would be the fastest-growing sequential segment in Q3? Will that be the GPU business, CPU or semicustom? Thanks.                                         
Lisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [82]
                                        
Jaguar, I think what we would say is that our Q3 guidance is both semicustom and graphics will be the drivers of the sequential revenue growth.                                         
Jaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [83]
                                        
Okay. Thanks. And then could you just give a bit more clarity around Vega timing? And also what do you expect to be your differentiation here versus what Nvidia has done with Pascal?                                         
Lisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",".                                            

Q: What is your guidance for Q3 revenue and units?
A: We expect Q3 revenue to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and units to be in the range of 2 million to 2.2 million."

Again, I think we'll talk more about the details of the Vega architecture in time, but certainly Vega is a high-performance GPU that will use high-bandwidth memory as part of it. So, I would leave the details for a more   as we go   get closer to the Vega launch date.                                         
Jaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [85]
                                        
Okay. Well, maybe just one final one then. When we get into the server CPU cycle with Zen, should we expect any kind of contribution from an APU format with CPU plus Vega? Because we're seeing a lot of acceleration now in the data center.",".

Yes, we do expect some contribution from the APU format with CPU plus Vega."
Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Do you think that could be a key product for you guys which maybe your competitors may not have, bringing an APU to the server market for high-performance servers?                                         
Lisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [86]
                                        
Yes, I think it's fair to say that we do believe we can combine high-performance CPU with the high-performance GPU. As we look at our GPU compute in general, sort of our both professionals graphics and server markets for GPU, I think that will increasingly become an area of focus for us as we continue to grow the graphics business.
So I think the answer is yes. I mean, obviously, it will come in time, but it's an area where combining the two technologies makes a lot of sense.                                         
Jaguar Bajwa,  Arete Research - Analyst    [87]

Before we begin, let me remind everyone that third-quarter 2016 was a 14-week quarter, and we expect to record our extra week in the fourth quarter of 2016. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions, and expectations, speak only as of the current date, and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. 
Additionally, please note that we will be referring to non-GAAP figures during the call, except for revenue, which is on a GAAP basis.","

What is the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP figures?

GAAP figures are based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), while non-GAAP figures exclude certain items that may not be indicative of our underlying business performance. Non-GAAP figures are used by management as a means to evaluate our operating performance and to make decisions about future investments."
Edited version Q3 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: The non-GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the press release and CFO commentary, posted on our website at QuarterlyEarnings.AMD.com. 
Please refer to the cautionary statements in today's earnings press release and CFO commentary for more information. You'll also find detailed discussions about our risk factors and our filings with the SEC, and in particular, AMD's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 25, 2016.

Thank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. Our strong third-quarter results highlight the progress we have made across AMD this past year, as we improved our financial performance by delivering great products.",".

Question: What was the main driver of AMD's improved financial performance in the third quarter? 
Answer: The main driver of AMD's improved financial performance in the third quarter was our improved product performance."
Edited version Q3 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Third-quarter revenue of $1.3 billion increased 27% sequentially and 23% from the year-ago period, driven by upside demand for our graphics products, and record semi custom sales. 
In addition to the significant revenue growth, we also achieved several financial and operational milestones in the quarter. We strengthened our balance sheet and improved our P&L through a series of capital markets transactions that reprofiled and reduced our debt. We also signed a strategic amendment to our Wafer Supply Agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES that provides sourcing flexibility and financial predictability. Most importantly, we delivered non-GAAP net income in the quarter, based on strong execution of our product road map, and growing momentum across our business. 
Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment, we had solid growth in the quarter.",".

What was the company's revenue growth rate in the quarter? 27%"
Edited version Q3 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Revenue increased 9% sequentially, and 11% from the year-ago period, driven by improved sales of mobile APUs and discrete GPUs. Mobile processor revenue and unit shipments increased for the fourth straight quarter, as 7th-generation APU shipments continued ramping, highlighted by the launch of our new PRO Series APUs earlier this month with HP. 
Customer and partner excitement for our Zen-based desktop product, Summit Ridge, is growing as we successfully passed several key engineering and design win  milestones in the quarter. We provided our first competitive performance preview of Summit Ridge in the quarter, and believe we will have a very competitive offering for the $4 billion high performance desktop processor market.

Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Obviously a lot has gone on in the last quarter. I figured I would ask a couple things about Zen, since that's been one of the things that's most topical, in my conversations with investors. 
Lisa, you talked about in your prepared remarks, there are  multiple OEM engagements and design wins for desktop, and also the same on server."," for each.

1. What is the total number of desktop and server design wins that AMD has announced to date?

Absolutely, Matt. Thanks for your question, and as you said, it's been a very busy quarter for us. As it relates to Zen, we are on track to launch in the first half of the year, for both our desktops and our servers. The desktop launch will go first, and it is on track for the first quarter, and then the server launch will go in the second quarter.

They're bringing up their platforms and software, and we're very pleased with how smoothly it's coming up, actually. 
So you asked specifically about the server side. Our focus on servers is really across the OEM business, including enterprise, as well as the cloud data centers. And I think the key for us is we're getting a lot of interest from our partners, and we continue to work with them to bring up their systems. But I think we are optimistic about where we are in the Zen bring-up, and the Zen launch cycle.

But we've also mentioned that we've made good progress on the professional graphics side, including both workstations, as well as server GPUs. 
I think the market is certainly very receptive to growth in the server GPU area. I was just at the Alibaba Cloud computing conference last week, where we announced our collaboration with them. They're actually using parts that are pre-Polaris and pre-Vega. We were demoing a GPU-based cloud server based on some of our FirePro technology, using hardware-based virtualization. 
I think the main feedback that we've gotten from them, as well as multiple other cloud engagements, is the hardware looks very good.",".

I had two questions. First one, on the Alibaba deal, so this is not a new set of products you're developing, it's products you already have. And can you talk about, to the extent this is   a cloud services offering versus  deep learning applications, that they might be doing with your products? And I guess when I think about the architecture, I normally think about having an X86 processor sitting next to the GPU.",".

The first question is about the Alibaba deal. Can you talk about what the products are that they're licensing from you and what the architecture is?

Lisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [11]
                                        
Sure, Mark. So again, I think on the Alibaba deployment, it is the beginning of what we expect to be a long-term collaboration. So the work today is being done on a pre-Polaris base, but we do expect that will upgrade as we go forward. 
I think the key is, there are many, many applications, but what we're starting from is a GPU base cloud server application, so in virtualized environments, you can imagine cloud gaming or remote workstation-type environments which need a lot of graphics horsepower, as well as virtual desktop environments.",".

Great. A follow-up if I may. Last night Tesla announced that it was using NVIDIA for their self-driving car, but on the conference call Elon Musk, I think the expression he used, was that it was a tight decision between NVIDIA and AMD, which suggests that you're further along in solutions for deep learning and neural networking than most, including myself, thought."," for that.

Lisa, Devinder, nice job on the quarter. I guess, Devinder first. Just going to the December quarter guidance, you're characterizing it as seasonal.",". 

Devinder Goyal, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO 

Yes, we view the December quarter as a seasonal quarter. We expect our Computing and Graphics segment to experience lower revenue and operating income due to lower demand for GPUs in gaming and professional workstation markets."
Edited version Q3 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: 
I know  the trappings of talking about normal seasonal, because there's so much variance around it, but it does seem like in prior quarters, where you had a 14th week, that extra week actually did help revenue a little bit. I'm just kind of curious within the context of the December quarter guidance, how you're thinking about that extra week, both on the revenue line and on expenses.                                          
Devinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP, CFO and Treasurer    [17]
                                        
I think if you look at a 14-week quarter, I think, John, you're right, it depends upon many factors. Our 14-week quarter is in the Q4 time frame, which is this quarter we are in.",".

Q: So it sounds like you think that the extra week actually does help revenue a little bit. Is that something that you guys are thinking about as you go into guidance for this quarter?
A: We do believe that the extra week does help revenue a little bit, but it really depends on a lot of factors, including the quarter we are in and the product mix that we have."
Edited version Q3 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: On the revenue side, I would say looking at it overall, there's not much of an impact, as the extra week falls during the holiday season, when a large portion of our operations and our customers are in shutdown mode. There is an impact on the expense side, but that's already contemplated within the guidance of OpEx that I gave, the $350 million due to the extra week.                                          
John Pitzer,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [18]
                                        
That's helpful. And then Lisa, a little bit longer term. Over the last  several quarters, you've been somewhat forced to try to manage profitability levels to that breakeven line, given the lack of revenue growth."," that might help explain why you think that's still the case.

Why do you think that we're still at a point where we need to manage profitability levels to the breakeven line?

We continue to face headwinds in the PC market, and we are seeing some weakness in the mobile market as well. We are making progress in the gaming market, but we are still facing challenges there. We are seeing some growth in the data center market, but that's not translating into significant revenue growth yet."
Edited version Q3 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: 
But now that you're on this path of more sustainable revenue growth, I'm just  curious as you think about R&D specifically, how should we think about your desire to want to invest in higher rates, as revenue begins to grow from these levels? Because clearly, as Mark talked about on the last question, you've got a lot of potential new areas and opportunities to go after. Can you give us a sense as to what   to what degree you think you've been under-investing in R&D and how we should think about R&D investments over the next several quarters, as revenue growth  resumes?                                          
Lisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [19]
                                        
Absolutely, John. I think it's fair to say that we've been very prudent in how we've invested overall.",".

Question: What should we think about your desire to want to invest in higher rates, as revenue begins to grow from these levels?
Answer: We believe that our investments in R&D will enable us to continue to grow our business at a faster pace and provide us with the opportunity to remain competitive in the future."
Edited version Q3 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: If you look at our operating expenses, 2016 to 2015, although we've been relatively flat overall, we've actually increased R&D, relative to other elements of the P&L. 
But as we see revenue growth and as we've seen progress over the last couple of quarters, I think you've also seen us increase our R&D spend. I think there are several areas that we see as very large opportunities, and we talked about some of the graphics areas in the previous question with Mark. I also think in the data center, there's a large opportunity for us on the CPU side, as Zen fully comes to market. 
So I think we have an opportunity to invest a bit more in R&D as our revenue grows, but we're still going to be very prudent with how we do that.",".

What is AMD's R&D spending compared to other elements of the P&L?
AMD's R&D spending increased relative to other elements of the P&L in 2016."
Edited version Q3 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: I think the key metric there in terms of being net  income profitable this quarter, ensuring that we get free cash flow positive from operations for the full year, those are all important metrics for us, and we're going to continue to manage very diligently.

This is Chris Hemmelgarn on for Blaine. With Summit Ridge launching in Q1 of 2017,   how would you expect the channel to ramp that? Do you see it ramping pretty fully in the first couple quarters of the year, or are you looking for more normal PC seasonality?

I would expect that there will be a relatively good initial demand for Summit Ridge, that may be not quite at the seasonal patterns. From where we see, Summit Ridge is playing in a space in the high end desktop, that we currently aren't offering a product. So we believe we'll be competitive certainly with Core I5 as well as Core I7, and we will be launching in those areas.

We're very happy with how Polaris ramped in Q3. The customer demand across all geographies was very strong. Q3 was primarily a channel-based quarter. With our board partners, and as some of you noted, in the early part of Q3, we actually had some supply constraints, given the customer demand. We did catch up towards the end of the quarter. 
So very pleased with how that's ramped. I think it's a very competitive market.",".

Question: How do you make the decision on which products to manufacture at GLOBALFOUNDRIES versus manufacture somewhere else?

Answer: We make the decision on which products to manufacture based on where we are in the business."
Edited version Q3 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So we will have multiple products in 14-nanometer and 16-nanometer that will be sourced across foundries, and similarly when we talked about the Wafer Supply Agreement, we mentioned 7-nanometer as being a key target node for that. 
Relative to how we make the decisions, I think it's a combination of factors. It includes the complexity of the product. It includes the timing, customers, all kinds of things. So I think that's part of our product planning process.

I think that's one element, but frankly, I think what's more important to me is, I need to commit a strong, five-year product road map to the customers, and so we want to make sure that we have all the flexibility to ensure nothing happens. I'll give you just a little bit of context, Stacy, because I think you know our business well. 
In this past six months, we've ramped five new FinFET products. It's the fastest transition we have ever made in a process node, and it's gone really, really well. And I think what's helped us with that is the fact that we've had two sources ramping at the same time.

In your prepared remarks, you mentioned semi custom's decline and computing graphics to be up. Implies you'll have a pretty rich mix for Q4. Why is GM guided up only 1% given the really strong mix for 4Q?

Edited version Q3 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Q2 to Q3, we had a significant ramp in the semi custom space, which led to significant revenue in the EESC side,  and we were able to manage the margin flat quarter on quarter, which we are pleased with. Going to Q4, essentially with the Computing and Graphics business, that's what Lisa said ramping, and then EESC business, in particular semi custom coming down.

Lisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [50]
                                        
Yes. So I think if you look at our PC market share, as it's published by Mercury, we're talking about somewhere around 10%, plus or minus. I think we view that historically we've been higher than that in the PC market, and certainly the desktop market, especially the desktop channel market. We're fairly well-known by that customer set. 
So we're enthusiastic about Summit.",".

What is your view on the potential for market share in the PC market?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: We think the performance is right on the mark with what we wanted to achieve.

Joe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [51]
                                        
Okay. Great. And then, how are you thinking about as you think about bringing that chip to market, when will you make it available for third party benchmarks and sort of get a broader marketing program beyond the launch you've done?                                          
Lisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [52]
                                        
I would expect certainly there are a lot of confidential benchmarks at the moment, but in terms of third party benchmarks, you would expect that in the first quarter.

Congrats on a great quarter, and nice to see it all coming together. We don't have September sell-through data yet. It's  hard to predict holiday season, what it's going to look like for consoles. Perhaps the past two quarters' growth in EESC might be outpacing  expectations for consoles. 
So  my question is, first of all, is that right? Is there something that's helping your guy's units here, like initial channel stocking for the PS4 Slim or the PS4 Pro? And how should we think about the size of the benefit that you're going to get from initial channel stocking there?                                          
Lisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",".

Hi Lisa, thanks for taking the call. Can you give us an update on your channel stocking efforts for the new PS4 Slim and PS4 Pro? And what impact do you think they'll have on unit sales? Thanks."

So, Chris, I think the game console shouldn't be really looked at on a quarterly level, when you're looking at sell-in and sell-out. It's so different from the other markets. I would say on an annual basis, everything trues up. The thought process is, in Q2 and Q3, there is a bit of build ahead as the customers are really building for the holiday season. And the customers do so much of their business in the last six weeks of the year. That's when all of the inventory is drained. 
My view is that if you look on an annual basis, the game console business is doing quite well. We expect units to be up. We expect revenue for the business to be up for us, and the quarterly transitions are less important.",".

                                                   Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, I'm hoping that you can help me understand the dynamic of desktop microprocessors ramping down in front of the Ryzen ramp. My understanding was that Ryzen was the higher-end SKU that comped against the Core i5 or Core i7, which is above where the existing microprocessors competed in the stack.
So I'm wondering if we should think about Ryzen either cannibalizing the existing desktop microprocessors at a higher ASP or are you kind of ramping down the lower end? Or should we think about Ryzen layering on top of the existing lower-end desktop microprocessors? Thanks.

                                                   Yes, absolutely, Mark. Thanks for the question. So look, you are absolutely right. Ryzen is really a high-end desktop product. And I think the comment was really around our overall channel inventories in desktop, so we wanted to ensure a very smooth transition.
No question that Ryzen will layer on top, competing well in the Core i7, Core i5 range. But we also will eventually see a full lineup of Ryzen throughout the desktop portfolio.

Maybe you could talk through maybe as the new product launches and the GPU and CPU segments of the year, how do you think about gross margin in that computing and graphics segments and getting that back to profitability. And then quickly, I think you guys guided to $50 million in THATIC IP revenue. Any help about how that is distributed through the year would be really helpful.

Edited version Q4 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: We got both nice desktop channel as well as notebook acceleration as we went through the year.
In terms of channel inventory levels, actually they looked quite normal. I would say we drained a little bit of inventory in Q4. We would expect a seasonal slowdown as we go into Q1 ahead of our product launches, but nothing unusual in the channel inventory on the GPU side.

                                                   Yes. So in terms of our strategy, I think on both the CPU and the GPU side, we have been on a fairly deliberate path to ensure that we got to a very competitive roadmap. So on the CPU side with Ryzen and ""Naples"", we believe we will be quite competitive. On the GPU side, as we launch Vega, we will have a full stack top to bottom with new hardware.
We continue to invest in software, and our approach to software is really around open source and using the ecosystem and using the community and focused on the new APIs. So in gaming, we are very focused on DX12 and Vulcan.

You guide down 11% for the first quarter, which is above or below that number. And then how does mix change throughout the year, as you have a bunch of new products launching on one side of the equation, but perhaps not as many on the EESC side.                                         
Lisa Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President and CEO    [30]

What was the mix of products in the first quarter?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So for Q1, I think if you look at the   overall, the guidance sequentially down 11%, you would expect that the semi-custom business should be down more than that. And you have seen that in our numbers the past couple of years, so it is behaving as it normally would.
Sequentially, you would expect that the Computing and Graphics segment would be better than seasonal, given that we will have one month of Ryzen in the market. On a year-over-year basis, I would say the computing graphics business is where you are seeing the majority of the growth as we go into Q1 with both GPU as well as Ryzen driving that growth.
As we go forward in the year, I think the expectations are that the product launches tend to be faster in the CG segment.",".

Answer: We expect the segment to be better than seasonal, given that we will have one month of Ryzen in the market."
Edited version Q4 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: In other words, from launch to revenue ramp is faster because it's more consumer-based. So as we launch Ryzen in first quarter and Vega in second quarter, but then the notebook and embedded in the second half, you would expect to see that reflected.
On the EESC side of the business, we do have our Microsoft Scorpio design win that will ramp in the year. That's an important one from the semi-custom side. And we will see ""Naples"" ramp as well, albeit server will tend to be a little bit slower from design win to revenue ramp.

And I know you purposely didn't guide to it in your 2017 as a whole, but conceptually when you are launching a bunch of new products, is it fair to assume that the SG&A side of things to support those launches increases?

Edited version Q4 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: In 2016, we made some very targeted investments to products, which is   with the launches that are happening in 2017, I would say they are going to pay off in terms of all the products we have on track to launch in 2017.
We have invested in software. We have got obviously some go-to-market expenses as we get into 2017. But I would say that you see our guidance for Q1 2017 at $360 million. So you will see a trend of continuing investment in product roadmap, new product launches, software.

I guess first of all, a number of questions have touched on this, but with Ryzen launching and then Vega in Q2, you presumably see some pretty big channel fill in Q1 and into Q2. Could you just talk about how you see that impacting seasonality through the rest of the year. Q3, Q4 are normally bigger quarters for PC sales, but you got big product launches in the first half.

Edited version Q4 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: And the way we view it is yes, there's some bit of channel fill, but I think there's also some pent-up demand for really great products in the gaming space. Both Ryzen and Vega are targeted at those enthusiast gamers. So certainly we do expect   normal seasonality would say that the second half would be stronger.
Note that on Ryzen, we are starting first in the channel and with system integrators, and then OEMs will launch shortly thereafter. So you would expect a stage launch of our partners.

Edited version Q4 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: I guess I wanted to go back with my first question to the OpEx line. If you just look at total dollars spent, you are spending well below your two main competitors.
And I'm just kind of curious. As revenue growth starts to reemerge in the model, how should you think about   or how should we think about OpEx growth relative to revenue growth? Is there a target that you can give us that you'd like OpEx to grow half as fast as revenue?
Or are you at a point now where you see a lot of incremental investments that are worth doing that might have OpEx growth that are growing faster than that? Any guidance there would be helpful.
