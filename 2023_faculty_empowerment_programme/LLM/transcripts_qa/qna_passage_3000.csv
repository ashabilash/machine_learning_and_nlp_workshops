Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: It's a maintainability adjustment, which is good news because it will help us down the road with service profitability, which, if you recall, is a main contributor to get to the 14%. But since it's a new feature, we cannot go straight to what we achieved last year.
Revenue recognition at shipment, we've got to replicate it at what we call SAT, which is the Site Acceptance Test that the customers require. It's a little bit deferred. That's the difference from the beginning of the year. But it's good news. I think the rest we said earlier. We have a deferred balance that we will start netting into the number in 2018.

                                                   With KeyBanc Capital Markets. I had a couple questions. First, just on the uptick in IDM revenue. I was wondering if that was more EUV revenue recognition-related or if you're seeing a pickup in the 10-nanometer ramp?

Just wondering if you can help us understand what kind of growth you expect in 2018 on that line item.                                         
Wolfgang U. Nickl,  ASML Holding N.V. - CFO, Executive VP & Member of the Management Board    [57]
                                                   Yes. I don't think that we're going to give that detail. Probably, in general, on 2018, there have been a lot of questions there as well lately.",".

What is the installed base revenue growth expectation for 2018?"
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: I can't be completely quantitative on this right now, but I think we can give you a few pieces that will help you form an opinion. And certainly, I don't want to go down to a customer level here, but we already talked about EUV. We get to EUR 1 billion this year, and then we get to EUR 2.5 billion next year. So that's a EUR 1.5 billion increase. You will have seen an extremely strong installed base revenue this year. I mean, we're going to almost EUR 2.7 billion, which is up 25%. And if you'll recall, we said in our longer-term trajectory, we see that business going up in average by 10%. Of course, the service part of it is a pretty stable growth.",".

Question: What is the average growth rate for your service business over the next few years?

Answer: We see that business going up in average by 10%."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: It's a function of the installed base, but then the options and upgrades are a little bit more volatile. But I would, right now, assume that, that business is flat to slightly up next year.
And then for the rest of the business, the combination of EUV, holistic, in memory and in logic, we have experienced an extremely strong year this year, and we see 2018 at approximately the same level. And you have a bit of evidence there also when you look at our backlog, we've got EUR 5.7 billion in backlog. And even though we don't guide to backlog, I think the Street expectation was about just over EUR 1 billion in the orders for last quarter, and we took almost twice as much, EUR 2.1 billion.",".

Douglas P.E. Smith,  Agency Partners LLP - Research Analyst    [59]
                                                   It's Doug Smith from Agency Partners. Wolfgang, I was wondering if you could perhaps give us an approximate breakdown of the R&D spend between the EUV, metrology and inspection and DUV.

I don't know how far we have gone, but then on the other half, you have a good chunk of what I would call fundamental research that benefits all businesses.",".

What is ASML's approximate breakdown of R&D spending between the EUV, metrology and inspection and DUV? ASML spends approximately half of its R&D budget on EUV."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And then the   but it's less than EUR 100 million, and then the balance of EUR 500 million is all the way towards DUV. But from a directional perspective, EUV   we're still investing by the way, because we still have significant innovation. You heard about the 2000 coming out, for instance, now. We're just having upgrade of the first system to this 2000 level. But the rest is a bit more overweighed to deep UV, which over the next couple of years will start to come down. But applications, we're investing very heavily, like I said earlier in metrology.                                         
Douglas P.E. Smith,  Agency Partners LLP - Research Analyst    [61]
                                                   Right. And it's getting pretty close to the anniversary of the analyst meeting last year, where you provided the 2020 model update."," for that question.

What is the company's plan for generating revenue in 2020?
The company plans to generate revenue from its metrology and applications divisions in 2020."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: I was wondering, when would you expect to update that again? A lot of other companies have provided some 2020 models based on an upwardly revised WFE market.                                         
Wolfgang U. Nickl,  ASML Holding N.V. - CFO, Executive VP & Member of the Management Board    [62]
                                                   Yes. I mean, we haven't scheduled that yet, but we did one in '14. We did one in '16. So it's probably a good assumption that somewhere in '18, we're going to do one. I think we gave you quite a bit to work with because we pinpointed an EUR 11 billion revenue, but we gave some sensitivities, both around the market vector and the EUV intensity vector. And we're not updating this today.",".

Q: When will ASML update its 2020 WFE market model?
A: ASML plans to update its 2020 WFE market model in 2018."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: But I think what you can say is that the EUV adoption is well underway, and the lay accounts are not on the low end, as we talked before. And also, if anything, the market is very enthusiastic about end demand. So without updating it today, I think the probability on the low-low or the lower combination has gone down since the year. But expect we haven't picked a date yet, but I would say somewhere next year, we're going to do a session.                                         
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, CEO and President    [63]

What is the probability of EUV adoption in 2017? The probability of EUV adoption in 2017 is lower than before."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And Wolfgang alluded to it that you could argue that the, let's say, low scenario has become less likely. But I think you guys   looking at where the market is, I think we gave you enough information to just pick whatever you feel is more appropriate, right? And right now, I think an update on that model is really something we will do next year. And I think you have enough to work with.
And by the way, we first started to talk about 2020 2 years ago, and I think it's good that we have some followers now. That's no reason for us to come out with something different. May I remind you too of the fact that 1 year, 1.5 years ago, people were saying we were way too optimistic on our 2020 targets.","

1. What is the likelihood of a low scenario?
2. What is the likelihood of an update on the 2020 model?"

We just stay very consistent on what we've said, and I think we've given you enough to work with to the upside, if you believe in that.

What is your view on the potential for high NA EUV yields?"
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Given the enthusiasm and the strong progress you have made around EUV, how are your conversations happening right now with your customers? What kind of traction or commitment are they showing towards high NA EUV? Do they want you to accelerate adoption? If so, what would make you do that? And also, what would that mean in terms of the supply chain besides the ZEISS deal that you've already carried out? I'm very keen to understand how the thought process is right now around high NA EUV adoption.                                         
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, CEO and President    [66]
                                                   Yes, I think that's a very good question. I think in the latest discussions we've had with customers, there is no doubt they see the benefit of EUV full-stop.",".

What would make us accelerate adoption? If it means that we need to invest more in R&D, then we will do that. It's important to us that our customers are satisfied with the level of innovation and technology development we're making."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Now the question is about timing. And then we do see that from a timing point of view, there are some different requirements from customers from when they want to have the first tool. Now some of those customers would indicate, and then we have also pretty decent and deep discussions with them on what we could do there. So those customers indicated they would like to have this capability rather sooner than later. And if that would mean that we would have to set up an accelerated program, that actually means that we would also ask our customers to commit also in the acceleration and the cost of that acceleration. And that would be, I think, a precondition for us to accelerate.
Now this is the level of discussion that we are having today.",".

Question: What would be the precondition for ASML to accelerate its development timeline?
Answer: ASML would need to receive commitments from its customers to fund the cost of acceleration."
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Now   and I think   and it's not superficial. Those are pretty deep discussions. And we're pretty clear also on what it would take to accelerate and what are commitments from the customers, how that would have to look like, which, by the way, we haven't reached an agreement yet. So it's just for your information.
Now on the supply side, the gating item here is really the new optics, the optics that comes from ZEISS. This is exactly why we did what Wolfgang explained earlier. With the investment in ZEISS, we signed the R&D and the CapEx program. That's the gating item. Both will get from an EUV source point of view, the EUV high NA tool will have the same EUV source. No source difference.
The tool will be bigger, but we know how to deal with that.",".

1. What is the gating item for ASML's supply of new optics?
2. What is the investment in ZEISS that has led to this?"
Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: The real challenge is in the optics, and this is why we have started to go into this agreement with Carl Zeiss. And I would say that from this point onwards and from this moment onwards, that's really the gating item in this project.                                         
Amit B. Harchandani,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - VP and Analyst    [67]
                                                   And just maybe as an unrelated follow-up. You obviously had no EUV orders in this quarter, but I understand that you work on a commitment basis. You're in close touch with your customers. You could potentially still be doing some work in progress even if the administrative stuff hasn't happened. But at what stage does it become a balance sheet risk and you say, ""Okay. We really need these orders.","""

Amit B. Harchandani, Citigroup Inc, Research Division - VP and Analyst

Yes, we have commitments from our customers, but at this point in time, we are not yet at a point where we can generate orders. This is something that we are closely monitoring and we will continue to work towards getting to that point."

                                                   I think what you would then need to see is that 2018 is fully booked and the first part of 2019 also.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              "
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Wolfgang will start with a review of our Q1 financial performance with added comments on our short-term outlook. I will complete the introduction with some additional comments, the current business environment and our future business outlook.
Wolfgang, if you will.                                         
Wolfgang U. Nickl,  ASML Holding N.V. - CFO, Executive VP & Member of the Management Board    [4]
                                                   Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first highlight some of the first quarter accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the second quarter of 2018.
Q1 net sales came in at EUR 2.29 billion, somewhat stronger than guided, driven by product mix and a strong DUV business. Net system sales of EUR 1.67 billion was primarily driven by strong memory revenue, which contributed 74% of sales.",".

What was the main driver of Q1 net sales? 
The main driver of Q1 net sales was product mix and strong DUV business."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Logic, which now combines foundry and IDM sales, made up 26% of system sales.
Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 617 million, which was just above our guidance. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 48.7%, which was 70 basis points above the upper end of our guidance range, driven by both volume and mix. Overall OpEx came in slightly above guidance, with R&D expense at EUR 357 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 114 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 3.19 billion. During the quarter, we purchased approximately EUR 170 million worth of shares. This means we still have EUR 2.33 billion of our 2018/2019 share buyback program remaining.
Moving to the order book.",".

What was the gross margin for the quarter?
The gross margin for the quarter was 48.7%."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Q1 system bookings came in at a strong EUR 2.44 billion. 57% of the order intake was from logic customers, driven by EUV. Memory made up the remaining 43% of our order volume, driven by Deep UV. We took 9 new EUV orders in the quarter. Additionally, we received 4 orders for High-NA R&D systems from 3 customers, and on top of this, we sold options for 8 High-NA early volume systems.
High-NA is our next-generation EUV system, which will enable geometrical shrink beyond the next decade. The initial selling price for these High-NA systems is around EUR 270 million. We will receive 40% as a down payment, and the remaining 60% will be milestone based, with the majority of the milestone payments expected before shipment.",".

Question: What was the order volume for memory products in Q1 2018?
Answer: 43% of the order volume was memory products, driven by Deep UV."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: The options were sold for EUR 50 million each, with payments starting this year.
At this point, I would like to comment on our reporting of bookings and backlog going forward. As we have communicated a number of times in the past, we establish our joint demand forecast with our customers, they are very routine and comprehensive planning cycles. Order flow can be lumpy and therefore does not always reflect our business accurately. We believe reporting bookings and backlog provides limited value, and therefore, backlog will no longer be reported. If we want to provide some additional visibility during our initial EUV ramp phase, we will continue to report bookings throughout this year.",".

What is the reason for discontinuing reporting of backlog?"
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We currently plan to no longer report bookings beginning in 2019.
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the second quarter of 2018. We expect Q2 total net sales between EUR 2.5 billion and EUR 2.6 billion. Our total net sales forecast includes almost EUR 600 million for our EUV business, while we target to ship 3 EUV systems in the quarter. Our Q2 EUV revenue forecast is a combination of revenue upon shipment and deferred revenue from prior quarters. This catch-up of deferred revenue was previously forecasted for the second half of the year.
On EUV revenue guidance, we have communicated that we will provide quarterly guidance until we are recognizing the majority of revenue for a system at the time of its shipment.",".

What is the difference between ""Q2 total net sales"" and ""Q2 EUV revenue""?
The difference between Q2 total net sales and Q2 EUV revenue is that Q2 total net sales includes almost EUR 600 million for our EUV business, while we target to ship 3 EUV systems in the quarter. Our Q2 EUV revenue forecast is a combination of revenue upon shipment and deferred revenue from prior quarters."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We expect this to happen in Q2 and will therefore no longer provide quarterly EUV revenue guidance starting in 2019.
For the full year, our shipment plan has changed from 22 to 20 EUV systems. The change was due to a combination of anticipated end-of-year shipment logistic challenges due to multiple shipments in the fourth quarter as well as customer fab readiness. The 2 affected systems this year will ship early 2019 and will not impact customers' EUV production ramp plans. As a result of this adjustment, our EUV revenue for 2018 is now expected to be around EUR 2.1 billion versus EUR 2.3 billion that we had indicated previously. I would like to highlight, though, that we expect this reduction to be more than compensated by stronger DUV and applications businesses.",".

Question: What caused the change in shipment plan for EUV systems?
Answer: A combination of anticipated end-of-year shipment logistic challenges due to multiple shipments in the fourth quarter as well as customer fab readiness."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We expect our Q2 Installed Base Management revenue to again come in around EUR 600 million.
Gross margin for the quarter is expected to be around 43%, impacted by the significant increase in EUV sales in the quarter. R&D expenses for Q2 will reflect continued accelerated investments in our portfolio and will come in at around EUR 375 million. SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR 115 million.
We have started a new share buyback program for 2018 and 2019 of up to EUR 2.5 billion. In Q1, EUR 170 million worth of shares were repurchased. Additionally, we have also proposed a 17% increase in our dividend to EUR 1.40 per share to our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which takes place on April 25 here in Veldhoven.",".

Question: What is the expected gross margin for the quarter?
Answer: The expected gross margin for the quarter is around 43%."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: The dividend payment is valued at around EUR 600 million.
We are excited about 2018. Customers' demand for our products continues to be strong, with strengthening demand in DUV as well as applications. In addition, we see strong demand for EUV as customers ramp this technology in production and have committed to this next-generation technology. We look forward to a year of continued strong growth in both revenue and profitability.
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to you, Peter.                                         
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - President, CEO & Chairman of the Management Board    [5]
                                                   Thank you, Wolfgang. I would like to start off by announcing a major milestone reached this quarter regarding our next-generation EUV technology of high numerical aperture or High-NA.",".

Question: What is the numerical aperture of ASML's High-NA EUV technology? 
Answer: The numerical aperture of ASML's High-NA EUV technology is around 1.4."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We have aligned our development time line with customers, and we received orders for 4 High-NA R&D systems from 3 leading semiconductor manufacturers, targeted to start shipping in Q4 2021. We also sold to customers options to buy 8 early volume systems targeted to start shipping in 2024. Now this is a significant milestone in that it demonstrates customers' commitment to EUV technology for future nodes and provides great growth opportunity as we extend lithography technology beyond the next decade.
I will highlight some of the key product features in more detail later, but I would like to first address our view of the business and the demand drivers. As Wolfgang highlighted, had a good start to the year, and our business continues to perform very well.",".

Question: What is the significance of the orders for 4 High-NA R&D systems from 3 leading semiconductor manufacturers?
Answer: This is a significant milestone in that it demonstrates customers' commitment to EUV technology for future nodes and provides great growth opportunity as we extend lithography technology beyond the next decade."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: The positive industry environment and increasing litho intensity as customers migrate to more advanced nodes continues to drive strong demand for our products in both logic and memory markets.
Although this not   this does not come as a surprise, we're increasingly optimistic about our 2018 outlook as compared to a quarter ago as we see strengthening demand in memory while logic demand remains solid. Based on expected growth and current guidance, we expect to see a significant increase in revenue in the second half of the year. And in [some ways] stronger Deep UV will be primarily driven by memory, and stronger EUV will be primarily driven by logic.
We plan to ship to over 15 greenfield fabs in 2018.",".

What is the expected increase in revenue in the second half of the year?
The expected increase in revenue in the second half of the year is significant."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: It may be interesting to note that, of these fabs, the majority will be in the China region, of which 7 are for domestic Chinese customers.
Memory strength in both DRAM and NAND is driven by increasing content as well as expanding end market applications. In DRAM, our customers continue to migrate to the 1x nanometer node along with required wafer capacity additions to meet the increased bit demand. In NAND, a number of customers continue to ramp greenfield   new greenfield fabs and scale vertically via stacks-of-stacks, which requires additional lithography.
With strengthening demand in both DRAM and NAND, we see significant year-over-year growth. Based on current third-party estimates for both DRAM and NAND, bit demand growth against our view of bit supply growth, we don't see major concerns regarding supply-demand balance throughout the year.",".

What is the bit demand growth against your view of bit supply growth?"
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Logic demand continues to be solid as customers ramp 10- and 7-nanometer nodes, while the initial demand for the latter, the 7-nanometer node, is the primary driver behind the significant increase in EUV demand in this year.
On the ASML product side, let me start with an update of our EUV business. In EUV, we continue to make progress as this technology starts to ramp in volume production. We delivered a configuration that achieved 125 wafers per hour at a customer site and continue to drive improvements in throughput performance, demonstrating 140 wafers per hour at ASML factories. We continue to focus on improving availability and work with our customers in support of infrastructure around EUV and volume production.
Demand from our customers continues to be strong as they start ramping this technology in production.",".

What is the primary driver behind the significant increase in EUV demand in this year?
The primary driver behind the significant increase in EUV demand in this year is the initial demand for the latter, the 7-nanometer node."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: With a plan of 20 shipments in 2018, this represents a doubling of output over last year's shipments. As we now move into the volume phase of this new technology ramp, we will focus our operations and industrialization efforts on managing our supply chain and helping our customers with their fab readiness preparations.
As Wolfgang mentioned, we have shifted 2 systems to early 2019 due to a combination of customer fab readiness and anticipated challenges regarding the logistics around year-end shipments. However, based on our discussions with customers, our previously communicated estimates of their EUV layer adoption plans remain unchanged.",".

Question: What are the challenges around year-end shipments that have led to the shift in systems?
Answer: The challenges around year-end shipments are due to a combination of customer fab readiness and anticipated logistical challenges around year-end shipments."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: As a reflection of their continued commitment to EUV production plans, we took orders for 9 NXE:3400 systems this quarter in support of our 2019 shipment plan of at least 30 systems.
As mentioned in my introduction, High-NA is our next-generation EUV technology, which extends lithography and enables cost-effective scaling beyond the next decade. The NA of the new optical system will increase from 0.33 on current EUV systems to 0.55 on High-NA systems.
In addition to new advanced optics driving improvements in imaging, platform innovations in stage technology will drive improvements in overlay and productivity. We're currently targeting an initial increase in productivity to 185 wafers per hour. Last year's investments in Carl Zeiss SMT will further solidify our development time line and reduces the execution risk.",".

Q: What is the NA of the new optical system?
A: The NA of the new optical system will increase from 0.33 on current EUV systems to 0.55 on High-NA systems."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And with the addition of High-NA, ASML's product portfolio will include 0.33 NA, 0.55 NA EUV, dry and immersion Deep UV, i-Line as well as holistic products, all designed to work together seamlessly in production.
In Deep UV, we will increase our factory output to meet the market demand. Furthermore, our focus on productivity means we continue to boost our new system output, and we expect to exceed the record productivity level reached last year. In addition to increasing the maximum configuration output per system, we are also continuously increasing productivity of our systems in the field. For instance, we achieved an output of 6,000 wafers per day on NXT systems in a NAND fab, which translates to a 5% increase in productivity over a 12-month period.",".

Question: What will be the maximum configuration output per system?
Answer: ASML expects to exceed the record productivity level reached last year."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: With both increased system shipment output as well as productivity increases of systems in the fab, we are delivering further value to our customers via capacity and cost efficiency.
In Holistic Lithography, we continue to see growth across our full portfolio of software and metrology products. Our YieldStar metrology continues to gain broadening adoption, with recent growth via expansion in the memory market. We also shipped our first YieldStar 1375 system, which measures actual in-device lithography performance, enabling more accurate measurements of the device and thus driving yield improvements. We've shipped multiple pattern fidelity metrology tools, ePfm5, and are seeing initial positive customer results.","

What is the yield improvement for YieldStar 1375?"
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: This technology, where ASML's high-resolution e-beam technology is combined with our computational lithography software, will enable e-beam-based feedback to the scanner and deliver improved yield performance in volume production.
To further drive e-beam productivity performance and expand application opportunity in volume production, we are developing multi-beam technology. We successfully captured first images from our 3-by-3 beam proof-of-concept system. We see great growth opportunity in holistic litho business and expect its growth rate to exceed our overall revenue growth in the coming years.
To summarize, this year, we expect solid growth in both sales and profitability. We are more optimistic about our view of the year than we were a quarter ago due to the continued strengthening of memory demand while logic demand continues to be solid.",".

What is the projected growth rate for holistic lithography?"
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We are on track to achieve our 2020 targets, with significant growth potential beyond 2020. We plan to communicate our growth opportunity beyond 2020 at our Investor Day on November 8 this year.
And so last but not least, as many of you know, this quarterly call is the last call with Wolfgang online helping us to bring clarity to our results and operations. It goes without saying that at least with ASML, we'll miss him dearly, and we'd like to take the opportunity to thank him wholeheartedly for his invaluable contribution to ASML. Wish him all the best in his new challenge at Bayer, and we will follow him closely, you can rest assured.
And with that, we will be happy to take your questions.

                                                   (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Mr. Farhan Ahmad.                                         
Farhan Ahmad,  CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - VP and Senior Analyst for Semiconductor Capital Equipment sector    [2]
                                                   All right. Farhan Ahmad from CrÃ©dit Suisse. My first question is in regards to China on   did I hear correctly that now you're seeing 7 domestic companies in China, whereas on the last call, you had mentioned 5? Can you just talk about what customer activity are you seeing in China? And how is it split between memory and logic foundry?                                         
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V.",". 

Farhan Ahmad: Okay. So, I'm just wondering what kind of customer activity you're seeing in China? Are you seeing more memory or logic foundry customers? And how is it split between memory and logic foundry? Thank you. 

Peter T. F. M. Wennink: So, we're seeing a mix of both memory and logic foundry customers in China. We're seeing a bit more memory customers, but we're also seeing a bit more logic foundry customers. And it's split pretty evenly between the two."

                                                   Yes. I think China is a rapidly developing market, but I have to tell you that these are   like we said in the prepared remarks, these are greenfield fabs of different sizes but also 200-millimeter fabs. They are 200-millimeter initiatives. So it is   basically expands across all segments. It's logic, DRAM, NAND, logic being foundry. There's DRAM initiatives. There is NAND initiatives. So it's the   I would say, it's the entire breadth of the business that we're covering. And yes, it is moving, but we have to say these are greenfield fabs, which have a different pattern or an expected different pattern of ramping. Many of those fabs put in a first line to qualify the process, to qualify the first product, which will take some time.",".

1. What is the expected ramp for the 200-millimeter fabs?
2. What are the DRAM and NAND initiatives?"
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So we have to be careful with   although the number is significant, 7, we have to be a bit careful with the assessment of the speed with which they will ramp up, which will be a function of the successes that they have in qualifying process and product.                                         
Farhan Ahmad,  CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - VP and Senior Analyst for Semiconductor Capital Equipment sector    [4]
                                                   Got it. And then one quick question on the sustainability of memory shipments that you have seen this year. On your comments, you talked about the sustainability. Can you talk about some of the analytics that you have done that give you confidence that the memory demand that you're seeing is sustainable? And also, if I look at your orders, the orders in memory had declined a lot.",".

Farhan Ahmad,  CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - VP and Senior Analyst for Semiconductor Capital Equipment sector    [5]


Yes, we have done a lot of analytics on the memory demand and it looks like it is sustainable. We also see that the orders in memory had declined a bit this year, but that's mainly due to the fact that there are more suppliers than ever before and there is more competition."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Is that an indication that the customers are being disciplined in how they are ordering, and even though the memory industry profitability is very high, they're kind of building to meet the supply   the demand that they are seeing?                                         
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - President, CEO & Chairman of the Management Board    [5]
                                                   Yes. First, to talk about memory you have to split between DRAM and NAND. The way that we calculate this is that of course, we don't know what the bit demand will be. So we focus   basically, we use the available data from industry analysts, and we corroborate that with discussions that we have with customers and see how customers see this. I must admit that personally, I have sometimes the view that we're parroting after each other.",". Q1 2018: 

Is ASML Holding NV expecting a decrease in DRAM bit demand in the near future?"
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We're all using the same percentages. There's not a lot of difference there. So this is on the bit demand side. Now what we know better is the bit supply side. We know pretty well how many tools are out there. We know pretty well how they are used in terms of availability and throughput. We pretty know   we know pretty well what kind of technology is actually used, so we can calculate the bit supply pretty well as installed and as planned to be shipped.
Now with DRAM, that's pretty accurate because we know this pretty well. With NAND, there's a bit of a caveat there. We have to make certain assumptions on the mix of layer stacks and the timing of when they increase layer stacks and, of course, some assumptions on the yields that they are having.",".

What assumptions do you make about the mix of layer stacks and the timing of when they increase layer stacks in order to calculate the bit supply?"
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Now you could argue that ASML might not be the most or the best-positioned company to have an insight in there, but we work with what we know and what we hear. So this is what we then use, basically applying the same methodologies with DRAM, taking how many systems do we have in the field, what's their productivity, what is our assumption on the mix of the layer stacks out there and so on, in our yield assumption.","

What is ASML's assumption on the mix of the layer stacks out there?"
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: That's how we come to this view that we currently have that supply and demand are pretty much in balance for this year, taking into account the caveats, which I think there are a little more caveats in there than there are in DRAM as far as our insights are concerned.
On the order trends, well, actually, you're giving exactly the argument why we stop giving order guidance because it   you can draw easily very strange conclusions for it. I mean, the way that we plan our shipments is an 18-months in-depth view with our customers on their expansion plans, on their capacity rollout plans and on technology transitions. And orders come in from a very few customers in batches. So it doesn't say anything.","

What are the caveats in your view for DRAM supply and demand balance this year?"
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: When we give you guidance on what we believe the memory business is, it is based not on the order flow, it is based on the continued discussions we have with our customers on their ramp-up plans, their technology transitions. And that really drives our view of the business, not the order intake.

                                                   The next question comes from Mr. Sandeep Deshpande.                                         
Sandeep Sudhir Deshpande,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Research Analyst    [7]
                                                   I have 2 questions. Firstly, for Wolfgang. I'm trying to understand the R&D guidance that you have given. The R&D guidance for Q2 is higher than the 2020, even if you took an absolute amount on your 2020 guidance, 13% of EUR 11 billion, on a quarterly basis, it is higher.",". 

Wolfgang Schaeuble, ASML Holding NV - Chief Financial Officer 

The increase in R&D spending is mainly due to the ramp-up of our memory business. We are confident that our technology transitions will result in a strong growth in the memory business in the future."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Why it is higher? And is it going to sustainably remain higher? And secondly, if it is going to remain higher, why are you not capitalizing some of this R&D, given that, I mean, just what Peter said in his prepared remarks that some of these shipments on High-NA EUV are really going to happen in 2024, et cetera? So it's a very long way away as yet.
And secondly, Peter, I have a question overall on the High-NA EUV business. Is the cost structure any different with   in High-NA EUV given that Carl Zeiss is going to be such an important supplier there? I mean, clearly, it's an important supplier now and probably an even more important supplier.",".

The cost structure for High-NA EUV is not different from traditional lithography. Carl Zeiss will be an important supplier for both technologies."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And I'd like to thank you, Wolfgang, for all your support over the last few years while you were CFO of ASML.                                         
Wolfgang U. Nickl,  ASML Holding N.V. - CFO, Executive VP & Member of the Management Board    [8]
                                                   Okay. Thanks, Sandeep. As it relates to R&D, we have taken the investments up. We're very heavily investing in High-NA, both here at ASML and through our High-NA agreement order size. But we are also investing heavily in Holistic Lithography in the guided beam and the multi-beam solutions.",".

Question: What is ASML's investment in High-NA?
Answer: ASML is investing heavily in High-NA, both here at ASML and through our High-NA agreement order size."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We do firmly keep our 13% of revenue envelope in mind, and we're not going to be quite there this year, but we're going to make progress year-over-year in terms of a percent of revenues that we'll keep that in front of us.
As it relates to the capitalization, that's a function of the accounting rules. And as you know, when we talk to you, we talk based on our U.S. GAAP numbers. And there, you simply have to expense it. If you're interested in the capitalized version, you can always look at our IFRS numbers that we don't use internally in the management process where they get capitalized. Quite frankly, at the end of the day, it's all about cash flow. And there, you don't have a difference. So we manage ourselves based on the U.S.",".

What is the difference between the capitalized and uncapitalized versions of ASML's financial statements?"
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: GAAP numbers, which we also, quite frankly, like because it's a bit more conservative.                                         
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - President, CEO & Chairman of the Management Board    [9]
                                                   Yes. On your second question on will there be a different cost structure on the High-NA EUV business, I think from a product cost, yes. I think [from the start], there will be optics in there. Of course, there will be EUV source there. But I think in terms of the cost buildup, it will be somewhat different. To start with the optics, I mean, I think we explained this before. We've taken an equity interest in Carl Zeiss, but also, we've agreed with them that we will co-fund their R&D as well as their CapEx.",".

On the High-NA EUV business, there will be a different cost structure from the start. This includes optics in the product."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And the way that we get repaid on that funding is that we run this as a ""2 companies and one business"" kind of venture. So it means that we should both have   and there's an equal internal rate of return. Only as you can imagine, if we put significantly more absolute euros in there than they do, then of course, somehow you need to get an absolute euro return, which is also significantly higher.
And the way that we balance this or we compensate this is through the lens price. So it actually means that it's a pre-investment whereby you can get a discount on the lens price to get a return on your investment. So that's one, and that's different than what we do today.",".

What is the internal rate of return for ASML Holding NV's ""2 companies and one business"" venture?
The internal rate of return for ASML Holding NV's ""2 companies and one business"" venture is equal to the company's weighted average cost of capital."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And secondly, we use a   we will use with High-NA the same source, the same EUV source, which is the source that we're currently using also for 0.33 NA. So all that, you could say a learning curve of that cost price of the current source will be captured by the time that we start shipping High-NA. I think those will be the 2 main drivers for a different cost structure in High-NA as compared to 0.33 NA, which should have a positive impact on the gross margin to start with.

                                                   The next question comes from Mr. Hameed Awan.                                         
Alexander Duval,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst    [11]
                                                   Yes. It's actually Alex Duval from Goldman Sachs. Just wanted to clarify very quickly what you said in terms of the High-NA orders and option sales.",". 

What is the gross margin for High-NA orders and option sales?"
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Can I just clarify that you said the average selling price is actually EUR 170 million for the original tool sale? And therefore, how should we be thinking about the total amount of cash that you'll be getting from those initial 4 orders and when we get that?                                         
Wolfgang U. Nickl,  ASML Holding N.V. - CFO, Executive VP & Member of the Management Board    [12]
                                                   Alex, so just to be clear, 2-7-0, that's EUR 270 million is the initial price of these tools. And the way how the arrangement has been done on the R&D tools is that we get 40% right away. And then there are 6 equal milestone-based payments that will happen over the next couple of years.",".

Question: Can you clarify how much cash ASML will be receiving from the initial 4 orders for the R&D tools?
Answer: The initial 4 orders for the R&D tools will result in ASML receiving EUR 270 million."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And like I said in the prepared remark, we expect the majority of these payments will be in before the shipment actually happens. And then on top of that, we sold 8 options for early volume shipments, and they go at EUR 50, 5-0, million apiece, and those payments start this year. So it does exactly what we designed it for. We go through an accelerated development program to get this new technology in as soon as possible. And our customers help us with the cash flow because we talked about R&D, and we talked about our assistance in the Zeiss business. So I think those are the most important parameters around the cash flow.                                         
Alexander Duval,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst    [13]

Q: What is the expected cash flow from the early volume shipments?
A: The expected cash flow from the early volume shipments is EUR 50 million."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And just as a very quick follow-up, you obviously talked about these very high ASPs for High-NA. But there will be new iterations of the current generation of EUV, as I understand it, before we get to High-NA in coming years. So could you help us understand, should there be price inflation on these EUV machines in the meantime? And how should we think about that in the next couple of years?                                         
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - President, CEO & Chairman of the Management Board    [14]
                                                   Well, we   with that, we will do what we always do. I mean, when we provide more value to the customer, we actually look at what that means for them in terms of the litho cost per wafer or litho cost per transistor, however you want to calculate it.",".

""When we provide more value to the customer, we actually look at what that means for them in terms of the litho cost per wafer or litho cost per transistor, however you want to calculate it."""
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And in fact, we just split that value increase 50-50. We've always done that. We've done that since the inception of the company. And of course, value is very much driven by productivity. This is why productivity improvements in the current EUV and NA will happen over time, over the next couple of years. And that will drive also the value, which we're going to split with our customers.

But just qualitatively, it's all driven by 2 things. It's technology transitions. I think technology transitions, 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, they need significant amounts of Deep UV machines. The 7-nanometer node, as Mark Liu also mentioned, is in the minds of a lot of people. 10/7 is a big node. So   but that   the context of big, you need to see in the context of the end demand, yes? So I mean, what we're currently seeing in memory, for instance, is also a big user of our Deep UV systems, and it's driven by the demand out of the data centers.",".

So the Deep UV demand for 2019 will be strong. That's our   that's what we currently feel, yes? Now like I said, the end markets are really driving the ultimate demand for capacity extensions.

                                                   Sure, that's helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, on the EUV side, I guess 2 quick ones if I could sneak it in there. The first part is, how do we think about gross margins into the second half given the pull-in of some of the deferred revenues? And then given that you pushed 2 tools into 2019, should we infer that 32 could be the new number? Or is that just not reasonable?

I mean, you have seen, in the first half, we were over EUR 150 million in first quarter, 600 in the   almost EUR 600 million in the second quarter. It was EUR 2.1 billion for the year, so you see we have 2 heavy quarters coming. So you can clearly assume that the margin is going up.

But you have to realize that we're looking into 2019 where we really need to also understand the cutoff. At the end of 2019, I don't know exactly what we are going to have because we're not fully booked for 2019 yet. So I think, to be   to stay on the safe side, I will just say we said we are planning for shipping our capacity of 30 units. I would, for the time being, stay at the 30 units.

It has   it had more to do with the mask set. But 5-nanometer is going to have some implication or improvement especially with the layout. When do you expect your customers will be able to provide those design libraries with the EUV insertion that would enable design community to better understand the cost benefit of EUV?

As what we said before, it reduces the complexity. So I think we got some very good feedback there. Although we, of course, don't know exactly where they are with their customers and how they present their designs and their libraries to their customers. But we don't know, but the sounds that we're getting out of the customer base are optimistic, and I think it's corroborated by what they say publicly.

Last call, you talked about trying to target a 2,000 wafer per day throughput as a milestone for getting your DRAM customers incrementally upbeat about adoption of EUV. Where are we with those targets? And any incremental color on the DRAM adoption of EUV? Especially as you   as we go from 1x to 1y, there's only 1- or 2-nanometer decline, and I'm not sure about the cost benefit. Is that impacting? And then any context of a throughput target?

                                                   Yes. I think we've always said, DRAM introduction will be for 1 or 2 layers, and it really depends on the specific customer situation, what they will go for. I think   but you're right, I think the 2,000 wafer per day is kind of a generally accepted target in the DRAM space because of the lower cost that they can, of course, bear for their devices. I think 2,000 wafers per day is a function of the wafer per hour throughput, which we said we actually reached 25 and in   at the customer's site and then 40 wafers per hour here at ASML. So that's good. And that is a function of the availability, which is   actually, we have a clear target of going over 90%.",".

There's quite a few questions out there in the market about sort of levels of commitment, levels of layers. You just said that customers are confident and that they're comfortable with the progress you guys are making. And so therefore, you haven't seen any change in that   in your expectation of the layers.

Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: I think it is still over that capacity number. It is changing from time to time, up or down, because of the timing that our customers are currently looking at for their ramp. Because it is not only whether you use 6 or you use 10 layers, but it's also what is the wafer capacity that you are going to build. So I think it is   there is some changes back and forth, up and down, which is driven more by how much wafer capacity do they want to build. That has less to do with the technology but more with the end demand. And that is still above our capacity   build capacity.

                                                   Yes, but that is a method of how big is the end market.

My question is, it seems that it's costing way more in terms of lithography today than it was a few years ago because your revenues from memory are very significant.","

What is the reason for this increase in lithography costs?"
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So could you explain us, maybe is there an easy way to explain us why, in order to increase bits capacity, the industry needs to spend more today than it was maybe a few years ago?

But then your cost per bit still goes up, and then that still goes down. But what we're currently seeing, and I think that's kind of   a long time that we've seen memory prices, especially DRAM prices, staying very strong and even growing, while you could argue the cost of manufacturing goes up. That tells you something. I mean, we've always said memory is a commodity, and a commodity has a high price elasticity. Well, the price elasticity when prices go up doesn't mean that the demand goes down. No, it's just the opposite.",".

Question: What is the price elasticity of demand for memory when prices go up?

Answer: The price elasticity of demand for memory when prices go up is the opposite of what it is when prices go down."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: I think the demand is extremely high, and that means that even customers   that end customers are willing to pay the high prices. So for our memory customers, that's an easy choice. You have a net market that wants your product more than you can deliver, which actually means you buy the capacity, which may be at higher wafer cost, but your margins are significantly higher because of the market situation. So it is just business. They will buy what they need if the end market is there. And what you will see, if the end market is not there, they will buy less, and they will just squeeze everything out of the current installed base.","

What is the net market for ASML's memory products?"
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So I don't see the issue, yes? And I don't think customers see the issues because they see the end markets, they see their profit margins, they see the opportunities. We don't see, and certainly not in the DRAM space, an exaggerated buildup of supply. So they buy what they need, and it costs a bit more, but they also earn more.

                                                   Okay, that's very clear. So cost of bit still comes down, but it just, over time, gets   translates into more spending in lithography. And then maybe more specifically on NAND, you mentioned like clients who started adding to their stack on 3D NAND, increasing the number of layers.",".

                                                   Well, the cost per bit, when you stack and you use historical yield assumptions for this type of device, then it's clear, the cost per bit goes down, yes? So now from a lithography point of view, it is also clear to us there will be stacks-of-stacks. I mean, that's what every customer confirms. Now the big question is, after how many stacks do you need another? Well, after how many layers do you need another stack? That might be different customer per customer.",".

Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And then just coming back on the EUV High-NA discussion, you've made a few comments on value and pricing. But just obviously, there's been quite a challenging ramp from a gross margin perspective as the initial ramp of EUVs come in. Do you expect that we'll see a similar challenge as we start to introduce High-NA, start low and then increase? Or will it be starting from a much better starting point given what you've already learned on EUV as we transition to High-NA?                                         
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - President, CEO & Chairman of the Management Board    [46]

Question: What do you expect the gross margin challenge to be when introducing High-NA? 
Answer: We expect the gross margin challenge to be similar to what we experienced when transitioning from EUV to High-NA."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: You will always see that the first tools have a lower gross margin than the tools when you're in volume because you have the learning curve and the warranty that goes with that, which is always higher with the first tools. But like I said earlier, we have this agreement on our return on investment of the R&D and the CapEx we do with Carl Zeiss, which will translate into a reduction, a discount on the optics, which is the most expensive part of the entire tool. And the EUV source is the same source as we use in 0.33. So that learning curve will have kicked in by the time that we start shipping the High-NA tools.

What is the return on investment for R&D and CapEx with Carl Zeiss?"
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Smith,  Agency Partners LLP - Research Analyst    [48]
                                                   It's Doug Smith from Agency Partners. I saw that the wafer throughput for High-NA was actually higher than for low NA at 185 wafers per hour. Does that mean that the 2, low NA and High-NA, won't coexist, that the High-NA will just take over eventually?                                         
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - President, CEO & Chairman of the Management Board    [49]
                                                   That's a good question. I mean, it used to be the case that when you introduce a new technology, that you see a cannibalization of the previous one, which will not be the case for High-NA EUV. High-NA EUV will be used for the absolute critical layers.",".

1. What is the cannibalization of the previous technology? 
2. What is the absolute critical layer for High-NA EUV?"
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: It will be an expensive tool, EUR 268 million, but it will provide not only more productivity but also the geometrical shrink, as Wolfgang mentioned. So it means, for those layers where you need the shrink, you will apply the High-NA tool. For those layers where you don't need the shrink capability of a High-NA tool, you will use the 0.33 tool. So it's going be a mix and match. Everything that we're currently seeing and discussing with customers is going to be mix and match of 0.33 and the 0.55 NA tool. So that means that the 0.33 EUV tool will have a very long life.

Can you give us some color on how much you see your memory tool revenues increasing this year in 2018? And secondly, just a clarification on the EUV shipments. Clearly, the shipment numbers were very different to the revenue recognition numbers. So how should we think about that as we go through the rest of the year?                                         
Wolfgang U. Nickl,  ASML Holding N.V. - CFO, Executive VP & Member of the Management Board    [54]
                                                   I'll take the second one. You're right, if you take Q2, we've guided to almost EUR 600 million on 3 shipments. So we are planning to achieve a very important milestone where we basically can recognize revenue at the point of shipment.",".

Question: So you're confident that memory tool revenues will increase this year?
Answer: Yes, we are confident that memory tool revenues will increase this year."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We're confident that we'll achieve that, so that means we can recognize these 3 shipments right away when we ship them. But not only that. We can also recognize tools from Q1 and even Q4 that we had previously shipped. If you recall, Q1, we shipped 3 systems, and we recognized only one. So we basically have that catch-up order. And then from now on, you will see the revenue recognition at the time of shipment, so it's going to be much more in sync. So you have that one catch-up order in Q2.

Question: What is the main growth driver for ASML in 2018?

Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We've   throughout the quarter, we've seen there's a steady increase of the   or let's say a change in the demand plans from key memory customers. And when I try to analyze this, I think it is more focused on the DRAM situation. That's where we really saw   from month to month, we saw an adjustment of the demand plans. And as we said earlier, it's not so much the order pattern, it's more the 18-month forecast, and more importantly, the next 9 months that we have to agree with the customer, taking into account our own lead time. And this is where we have seen this gradual increase in the end demand and making sense.",".

Question: What do you think is driving this change in demand plans?

Answer: We believe that it is more focused on the DRAM situation."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: I mean, if you look at the end markets, I mean, the DRAM markets, look at the DRAM pricing, and look at the announced capacity additions over the last 3, 4 months, customers are reallocating memory types to free up space for memories where they can make most money, which in this case is DRAM. And all that's happened over the last 3, 4 months, and that drives up the demand. And we're able to respond to that demand because we have reduced our cycle times. So that   it's   that's what it is. It's just the more clarity that we've been given by our customers on what they need this year.

Tammy Qiu,  Berenberg, Research Division - Analyst    [60]
                                                   Tammy Qiu from Berenberg. Firstly, can you talk briefly about what trend you are seeing at foundry and logic? Because from my understanding, apart from EUV momentum in the second half, foundry and logic should be stronger than your January expectation. Can you just talk us through what's the driver and what can be the early indication into beginning of 2019? And also, the second question is on multi-beam tools. You said that in the presentation, you already demonstrated the first 9-beam tool.",".

The trend at foundry and logic is strong. The driver is the increasing demand for high-performance semiconductors. This demand is being driven by the growth of the internet of things, 5G, and other emerging technologies. We are seeing early indications that this demand is starting to pick up in the second half of 2018. Multi-beam tools are also performing well. We are seeing increased demand for these tools, which is being driven by the increasing demand for high-performance semiconductors."
Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And can you actually talk about what exactly can you bundle that tool with your new system so that you can have a higher ASP with existing system? Or are you going to sell that tool as individual tool? And also, what's the potential number of beams you can bundle into the single machine? Because from my understanding, everyone in the industry has been working on a real multi-beam tool for the past 2 decades, but no one has achieved anywhere close to commercialization.

I think it's been pretty well laid out. We feel pretty happy with this also in terms of business volume. So I think it's a bit too early to   for us to currently help you with any indication on an accelerated growth in that area. I would love to do that, but I have to rely on our own process, and our own process says it's going to be pretty healthy, that it's pretty stable.

Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first highlight some of the fourth quarter and full year financial accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the first quarter of 2018.",".

- ASML Holding NV reported fourth quarter 2017 revenue of €2.5 billion, an increase of 7% compared to the same period in 2016.
- The company's operating income was €1.2 billion, an increase of 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.
- The company's net income was €898 million, an increase of 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.
- The company's diluted earnings per share were €1.27, an increase of 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.

The company's full year 2017 revenue was €7.4 billion, an increase of 7% compared to the full year 2016. Operating income was €4.9 billion, an increase of 8% compared to the full year 2016. Net income was €3.5 billion, an increase of 9% compared to the full year 2016. Diluted earnings per share were €2.92, an increase of 9% compared to the full year 2016.

The company's outlook for the first quarter of 2018 is as follows: revenue is expected to be in the range of €2.5 billion to €2.7 billion; operating income is expected to be in the range of €1.5 billion to €1.6 billion; and net income is expected to be in the range of €890 million to €900 million."
Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: 
Q4 net sales came in at EUR 2.56 billion, exceeding our guidance by over EUR 400 million. Due to demand strength, some customers requested earlier shipments of lithography systems, which we were able to accommodate late in the quarter. This accounted for almost half of the EUR 400 million, and the other half came from earlier-than-expected acceptance of the performance of 2 previously shipped EUV systems by a customer, which led to recognition of deferred revenue in Q4. Net system sales of EUR 1.95 billion was strengthened by memory, which contributed 53% of sales, foundry accounted for 29% and IDM was 18% of system sales. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 606 million, which was in line with our guidance.",".

Question: What accounted for almost half of the EUR 400 million increase in net sales in Q4?
Answer: The increase in net sales came from earlier-than-expected acceptance of the performance of 2 previously shipped EUV systems by a customer."
Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: 
Gross margin for the quarter came in at 45.2%, which was 120 basis points higher than our guidance. This was the result of much stronger-than-expected DUV sales, more than offsetting the dilutive effect from incremental EUV revenue that was recognized during the quarter. Overall OpEx came in slightly above guidance, with R&D expenses at EUR 317 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 113 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments came in at EUR 3.29 billion. During the quarter, we purchased approximately EUR 331 million worth of shares. Since January 2016, we have purchased a total of approximately 8.2 million shares with a value of EUR 900 million against our 2016 and '17 authorization of EUR 1.5 billion.
Moving on to the order book.",".

What was the gross margin for the quarter? 45.2%"
Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Q4 systems bookings came in at a strong EUR 2.93 billion. This is almost an EUR 800 million increase compared to Q3 bookings. The order intake was driven by the memory sector, representing 55% of orders, compared to 30% for foundry and 15% for IDM. We took 10 new orders for EUV systems, and our EUV backlog now reflects 28 systems valued at EUR 3.1 billion. Our overall system backlog now totals a record EUR 6.68 billion and is balanced nicely between memory, foundry and IDM.
Our strong Q4 results marked the closure of an exceptional year for the industry and ASML. For the full year, our net sales grew 33% to a record of EUR 9.05 billion. Net Installed Base Management sales grew more than 25% to a record of EUR 2.68 billion.","

What was the order intake for systems in Q4?
The order intake for systems in Q4 was driven by the memory sector, representing 55% of orders, compared to 30% for foundry and 15% for IDM."
Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: With total EUV sales almost at EUR 1.2 billion, 2017 was the year when preparations for inserting EUV into high-volume chip manufacturing shifted into a higher gear. Of the 12 EUV shipments planned for 2017, we shipped 10 during the year. One shipment is in progress, and one shipment is planned this month. This means that our 2018 shipment plan will increase by 2 to a total of 22 systems.
We made considerable improvements on our EUV gross margin in 2017, achieving 0% in the fourth quarter. Due to accelerated investments in EUV service infrastructure, we had not achieved 0% for the full year. Nevertheless, even with a more than 3x increase in EUV revenue from 2016 to 2017, we were able to improve our corporate gross margin to 45%.",".

Question: What was the reason for the decrease in gross margin in the fourth quarter?
Answer: The decrease in gross margin in the fourth quarter was due to increased investments in EUV service infrastructure."
Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We are on track to achieving overall gross margins exceeding 50% in 2020.
We continue to invest in the long-term future of ASML, and increased R&D from EUR 1.1 billion in 2016 to EUR 1.26 billion in 2017. This increase was driven by accounting for a full year of HMI, our contributions to Zeiss SMT and our own investments in high NA. Overall R&D investments as a percentage of revenue decreased from about 16% in 2016 to about 14% in 2017. 
SG&A as a percentage of revenue reduced by almost 1 percentage point to about 4.6% of revenue.",".

What is ASML's investment in R&D as a percentage of revenue?

With that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the first quarter of 2018. We expect Q1 total net sales of around EUR 2.2 billion. As a reminder, we pulled approximately EUR 400 million from this quarter into Q4 2017. While we target to ship 4 EUV systems in the March quarter, we expect revenue recognition of about EUR 150 million for all EUV business. Overall, we do expect quarter-over-quarter revenue growth throughout 2018. We expect our Q1 Installed Base Management revenue to come in around EUR 600 million. 
Gross margin for Q1 is expected to be between 47% and 48%.",".

What is the expected revenue recognition for all EUV business in Q1?
The expected revenue recognition for all EUV business in Q1 is EUR 150 million."

Thank you, Wolfgang. As Wolfgang highlighted, that we had another record year in 2017. The demand for our full product portfolio was very strong, and our business continues to perform very well. The strong demand in both logic and memory set new revenue records across both sectors in 2017.",".

Question: What was the total revenue for 2017?
Answer: The total revenue for 2017 was EUR 24.5 billion."
Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Expanding end market applications, IC device content growth, increasing litho intensity, all evidenced by our strong backlog, provide a good basis for this positive momentum to continue in 2018.
Most others, but certainly due to high demand from the server market, DRAM system demand remained strong as our customers continue to migrate to sub-20 nanometer nodes. Advanced nodes are more litho-intensive and, thus, drive increased litho demand. In 3D NAND, litho demand is also strong, as a number of customers continue to ramp through greenfield fabs and scale vertically with so-called stack-of-stacks. Additional lithography is required to connect these stacks, which further drives up litho intensity.",".

Question: What is the main reason for the strong backlog?
Answer: The strong backlog is due to the increasing demand from the end market applications, IC device content growth, and increased litho intensity."
Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: But adding the NAND opportunity to the DRAM business outlook for next year, we see another strong memory year ahead.
Logic demand continues to be solid as customers ramp 10-nanometer and starts transition to the 7-nanometer node. Litho intensity continues to increase with migration to more advanced nodes with further growth with the adoption of EUV at 7-nanometers. EUV production ramp will accelerate in 2018 as customers are eager to realize the benefits of process simplification, cycle time reduction, yield improvement and ultimately resulting in cost benefits.
In regards to China, we set a new record for this region in 2017 with over EUR 700 million in revenue. In addition to strong demand from existing customers in the region, we're also planning to ship to 5 domestic Chinese customers in 2018 for both memory and logic applications.",".

Question: What is the new record for China in 2017?
Answer: The new record for China in 2017 is EUR 700 million in revenue."
Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: With continued ramp of fabs in China, both from domestic and nondomestic customers, we see a very clear growth opportunity in this region over the coming years.
On the ASML product side, let me start with an update on our EUV business. In EUV, we continued to make significant progress in 2017. We demonstrated all system specifications, including 125 wafers per hour, while continuing to improve availability. Customer demand is strong, evidenced by public statements of their plans to introduce this technology, with volume production starting in 2018. We booked 10 EUV orders in Q4, bringing our backlog to 28 systems in which we plan to shipment 22 in 2018. Shipment profile, however, will be back half-loaded as our planned step-up in move rate will effectively only have an impact in the second half of 2018.",".

Question: What is the shipment profile for ASML's EUV systems in 2018?
Answer: ASML plans to ship 22 EUV systems in 2018."
Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Our EUV shipment plan beyond 2018 is unchanged with 30-plus in 2019 and 40-plus in 2020.
In Deep UV, we shipped a total of 161 new systems in 2017, which is a 21% increase from 2016. We were able to significantly boost output in support of our increased customer demand in both memory and logic. We also provided customers with an early access version of TWINSCAN NXT:2000, which is our most advanced immersion lithography system. It's used for process development of the NXT node devices. As a sign of the continuously increasing maturity of the NXT platform, the NXT:2000 system already meets or exceeds all of its performance targets. With 3D NAND customers, we expanded our options portfolio. We addressed critical process challenges and delivery of improved performance.",".

Question: What is the total number of systems shipped in 2017?
Answer: The total number of systems shipped in 2017 was 161."
Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: 
In Holistic Lithography, we showed growth across the full portfolio of software and metrology products. We shipped our first jointly developed product less than 1 year after closing of the HMI acquisition. This product, ePfm5, the pattern fidelity metrology system that leverages HMI's high-resolution e-beam metrology with ASML's computational lithography technology. This product's high-resolution capability enables high capture rate of systematic patterning defects so customers can accelerate their yield learning curves and drive higher production yields. Both of these, we shipped our first EUV e-beam mask inspection system.
As to 2018, we expect continued solid growth in both sales and profitability. Our high-level view of 2018 business is largely unchanged relative to comments that we made last quarter.",".

What is the first jointly developed product that ASML shipped in less than 1 year after closing of the HMI acquisition?
ePfm5 is the first jointly developed product that ASML shipped."
Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: While we were able to recognize an additional EUR 400 million of revenue in 2017, which could be seen as a pull-in from 2018, it will not impact our view of 2018 as it will be wholly compensated by increased Deep UV demand.
In summary, we had another record year in 2017 with 33% revenue growth and 44% net income growth over 2016, strong demand in both logic and memory set new revenue records in 2017, and we expect both sectors to see continued growth in 2018, supported by increased EUV sales. Expanding end market applications, device IC content growth, increasing litho intensity, as evidenced by our record backlog, provide a strong indication that this positive momentum will continue in 2018. 
With that, we will be happy to take your questions.

It has to do with the fact that the step-ups in capacity are really long lead time items. So this is not something that you change one quarter to the other. So the supply chain situation is what it is. And I think the 30-plus is limited, as we said before, by the supply chain, and the 40-plus is really when this supply chain can kick into the next steps.

Okay. And I guess as my follow-up, you guided gross margin higher year-over-year despite the nice tick higher in EUV shipments.",".

What was the main driver of higher gross margin? 
The main driver of higher gross margin was the increase in EUV shipments."
Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So curious, if you think about non-EUV and growth in inspection and an uptick on the DUV side, is it fair to say that, overall, that part of your business can do roughly 53%, 54% gross margin through the year?

I wouldn't like to nail it down to an exact percentage. But if you look at both other businesses, so the Holistic Lithography business and the Deep UV business, you will see an increased mix towards the more powerful machines, and that has a positive effect on gross margins. Also, we continue to do a lot of very profitable upgrades.",".

Q: What is the company's outlook for non-EUV and growth in inspection and an uptick on the DUV side?"
Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And then from a mix between Deep UV and Holistic Lithography, you will see also, the next 2 or 3 years, a continued mix towards Holistic Lithography, which will have a slightly higher mix in our overall revenue. And since this is a very software-driven, it structurally also contributes to the non-EUV business being up, so both effects. Both of these businesses go up based on the products that we offer, and then you also have a mix base effect. And that, of course, comes together with us making significant progress on the EUV. And that's why we feel confident that from the 45%, we can advance in 2018 and then get to our 50%-plus in 2020.

C.J., if I just may add one general comment on this is, going forward, I mean, we are guiding   and as we did, we are guiding a corporate gross margin, and going forward, we will do that. Because if you look at what our customers really want from us is node-to-node transitions, and node-to-node transitions, going forward, are really a combination of the entire set of products and services that we are offering.

Q1, for instance, we're planning to ship 4 systems, recognizing only EUR 150 million. There are still shipments that have   of tools that have changes in them that require us to wait with revenue recognition for an acceptance of the tool at the customer side. So these Q1 shipments will, however, recognize in the second half of the year. On top of that, we are carrying a deferred revenue balance of around EUR 500 million on our balance sheet from prior shipments, and they're both short term and long term. So some of them will come into the P&L in 2018, and some will even carry a little bit into 2019.",".

Yes. I think what we're working on, and because it's also on customer request, is clearly a reduction of the cycle time of our EUV tools. I mean, it has to come down by 2020. We really like to be at the cycle time anywhere between 12 and 15 months.",".

Now currently, we are in discussion with our customers under what terms and conditions we should start shipping the first R&D tools and how quickly after the R&D tools we should start ramping up for volume.

And if they would do it, let's say, at a speed with which we would normally see in memory and in logic, you could probably get to a number that's almost twice as high as the EUR 3 billion.

Whereas if you compare it to the memory, there's been a significant uptick there. So how should we think about growth in memory revenues in calendar '18?

Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the foundry business. I think you mentioned that there's been a slowdown in revenue growth in that segment. Can you give us a little more color on what's driving that? And secondly, I wanted to ask about memory. You mentioned that there's been a significant uptick in memory revenue.

Thank you, Peter. Our response is as follows. In terms of the slowdown in foundry revenue growth, we don't have specific details yet, but we're working closely with our customers to understand their needs and see if we can accelerate growth.

Yes. I think we've   both for memory and logic, we see similar patterns in 2018 with   there are some potential upside, which is customer-driven. I think that the second half of your question is probably more relevant one because it comes up time and time again. The way we look at this is, are we creating an overcapacity in terms of the bit supply into the memory market, both DRAM and the NAND. Now if we look at what our customers are currently asking us and the forecast that they give is for what they want in 2018 is, of course, not fully yet in the backlog.",".

Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And if we take that and we take into account the nodes that they want to use this on, the effect it will have on the bit density, then we can calculate what the capacity addition will be in terms of bits. And in DRAM, where we will be probably anywhere   let's say, mid-20s max, yes? So anywhere between 22% to 25%. And in NAND, the capacity addition of what we can see based on litho will be around mid-40s. And these are   the way currently our customers are talking about and the analysts are talking about it, it's about the same as the demand bit growth looks like. So when we take those 2 together and we look at the capability of the lithography machines to add bits, it seems that it's pretty much in balance.","

Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: You have to realize that nobody has EUV in full production yet.

We'll eventually start in the back half of 2018, but that capability is actually there. And there are some tests that are being done by customers and by us. They'll show us that capability. Now with respect to the availability with the 3400, we're over 80%. We seek significantly over 80%. And I think the target by the end of this year will be that the availability numbers are such that customers feel comfortable to put the tools into production that will give them around 1,500, maximum 2,000 wafers per day.",".

Question: What percentage of the time are you at 80% or over?

Yes. To answer the last part, China, of course, we have greenfield fabs there. They don't go into ramp, like I said, in   as an answer to an earlier question, aren't going to ramp up with the same speed as the mature memory companies. So they will take those tools and will use those tools to create a first line where they can qualify their product.",".

A1: There are currently two DRAM fabs and one NAND fab in China."

Now split between DRAM and NAND is very difficult for the simple reason that customers are continuously assessing how to allocate their lithography capabilities and their capacity between DRAM and between NAND, and there are a lot of relocations going on between DRAM and NAND. That's why some time ago, we decided to just give you the memory segment as one segment and don't split between DRAM and NAND because they are continuously changing because of those   the reallocations.

It was because the customer signed off on the specification that we agreed when we shipped the tool. So no better or worse specification, just we met the specification in the sign-off.

Okay. Mask inspection, well, we shipped the first e-beam mask inspection tool through our HMI subsidiary. Mask, in itself, as we also showed in the presentation this morning, whether you have the excess   but at least, we show we make significant progress on the pellicle development. So let's say pellicles are now able to be used at the 250-watt power level. Lifetime of pellicles is going up. We're all moving very nicely into the volume production area. And so masks and the mask infrastructure, we don't think there's any issue that will prevent our customers to put EUV into volume production in the course of the year.",".

Well, I think it's similar to the current EUV tool. I mean, when we   5 years ago, the current EUV tool did not fit into many of the fabs at that moment in time. I mean, it's a better fab height. It's the strength of the floor.",".

That's been communicated, and I hope customers will build new fabs, not only because high NA, because the market is growing and we need more of those devices.

Great quarter, by the way. I noticed that the dry EUV moved up from 20 units to 25 units, Q3 to Q4, but the immersion went from 22 to 20. Is that evidence of the increasing importance of NAND in your portfolio?

No. I think to draw conclusions on the quarter-to-quarter comparison between Q3 and Q4 is   I think you probably shouldn't do that because it's   it could be all kinds of incidental factors, customer-specific shipments.

Got it. On a kind of related issue, I was wondering, are you seeing any evidence yet that with the traction of EUV, customers might be planning on ordering fewer immersion systems, which I guess is kind the whole point of introducing EUV in the longer term?

Yes. I think   what I think, it's probably best is we look at our Analyst Day of 2016. We gave you a couple of scenarios where high EUV introduction, lower EUV introduction for several reasons. It could be EUV not as effective as we then, at that moment in time, planned or whether markets were different.",".

Question: What are the reasons for the lower EUV introduction scenario?

Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And you can actually conclude from those scenarios that higher EUV will lead to somewhat lower immersion, but still significant. And it's logical because it will cannibalize some of the multiple patterning layers. On the other hand also, layers are growing, yes? So it also   so basically, there is a dilutive effect in that sense that you have more layers, and some of those layers will be deep UV layers, will be the immersion layers. So no matter how you look at it, the number of EUV and of immersion systems will still remain significant, also with high EUV introduction. So   this is I'd like to refer back to that   to those 4 scenarios that we showed in the end of 2016.

I think, by the way, that if you look at over the lifetime, over a very long period, it's actually not cannibalizing immersion at all because EUV, at one point in   without EUV at one point in time, there wouldn't be even new nodes.

Sure. Now I wanted to reconcile this with large-source capacity. How long will it take for ZEISS to add additional capacity? Do you have any flexibility to accelerate investment there or accelerate capacity, manufacturing capacity so that your 30-plus target for 2019 could increase? And I'm asking you this because if you're able to increase confidence among your DRAM customers that you can actually do 2,000 wafer per day, wouldn't they need to place a PO before '19? And wouldn't some of these EUV shipment would have to take place into DRAM customer by late '19? So doesn't that create a kind of a double-edged sword? And I want to get your view on the kind of levers that you can pull to accommodate these DRAM customers.",".

Yes. It's   you're making   you're asking very elaborate question, and I'll give you a very simple answer. The way that we   the lead time to increase capacity at ZEISS has lapsed. I mean, we are where we are today. The only way to get 30-plus and how much the plus is, is dependent on the cycle time reduction in the factory of ZEISS. The faster they can do that and the better they can do that, the more we can squeeze out.

Okay. And the second question is, you talked about the EUV won't actually limit the demand for Deep UV. So in general, I would say, does that mean equipment have to become more and more expensive for the chip makers over time, so therefore they will have to keep buying the more expensive and more equipment for making a leading edge node? So I'm not sure how you view this point. Do you, as an equipment maker, need to cut the price at certain point so that they don't have to pay crazy CapEx all the time? Or can they actually pass on the incremental CapEx to their customers?                                         
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V.",".

The answer is that the equipment makers do not need to cut the price at certain point in order to keep the demand for Deep UV."

Well, what you're basically asking is, is Moore's Law still viable, yes? Because when I just   well, just before the press conference, I bumped into one of the really senior ASML lab leads, and he said, ""You know, this is great where the company is going. I still remember sending out the first invoice for $1 million. Now we're selling a EUR 120 million tool."" So to your point, yes, customers have started to pay a lot more for those tools.",".

Question: What is the average selling price for ASML's tools?
Answer: ASML's tools are typically sold for a price between EUR 120,000 and EUR 1.5 million."
Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: But of course, the transition and the cost per function has continuously gone down on a logarithmic scale, yes? So is Moore's Law viable? Yes, we believe it's still viable, and yes, our customers will pay higher price for our machines whereby the cost per function will keep going down.                                         
Operator    [62]
                                        
The next question will come from Mr. Andrew Gardiner.                                         
Andrew Michael Gardiner,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director    [63]
                                        
It's Andrew Gardiner from Barclays. We spent quite a bit of time talking about memory this afternoon. I was just wondering if we could spend a minute or 2 on logic and just in terms of the   first on the near-term thinking through 2018 and the sort of strength or sort of node migration plans in place there.",".

Andrew Gardiner:

Thank you. So, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the node migration plans that you have in place for 2018? And can you give us a little bit more color on the types of nodes that you're looking to migrate?"
Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: How do you view your sort of visibility into that logic business this year? I presume it's better or sort of firmer than we see in memory, where you seem to be highlighting the potential risk in the back half or, at least, lack of visibility in the back half. But how   so where's your conviction level or   to where a customer sort of order rates in terms of the 10 and 7 nanometer migrations?                                         
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, CEO and President    [64]
                                        
Yes. I think what we've   we haven't changed our view as compared to 1 or 2 quarters ago. I mean, the logic 10-nanometer ramp is still going, actually, to the areas in China, where we're shipping 14 and 28.",".

Q1. What is your view on the visibility of the logic business this year?

Our view is that the visibility is better than we see in memory, where we highlight the potential risk in the back half or, at least, lack of visibility in the back half. However, we still have conviction in the back half."
Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And more importantly, I think what we will see is by the back half of the year, we'll start to see EUV going into 7-nanometer pilot production. This ramp, I think   and also, if you look at the comments made by our customers and their assessment of the size of the nodes, there is no reason whatsoever to believe that they   that there is an indication that those nodes will actually dwindle in terms of number of wafers that they would need to build that capacity. And on the contrary, I think comments are being made by customers on the 7 and 10-nanometer nodes as being very large nodes, and they're seeing a lot of [date bounce]. So there is no indication whatsoever to change our view.",".

Question: What is the ramp for EUV production?

Answer: The ramp for EUV production is by the back half of the year, we'll start to see EUV going into 7-nanometer pilot production."
Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And like I said earlier and we look at the memory and the logic business, we see 2018 developing at least at the same level as 2017 for both logic and memory with some upside here and there.                                         
Andrew Michael Gardiner,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director    [65]
                                        
Okay. If I could just have a quick sort of accounting follow-up for Wolfgang. We're starting to see the sort of the ZEISS investment come through in terms of the equity income line. It was somewhat negative in the fourth quarter. Is there a rough rule of thumb we should be thinking of as we put that in our models for future periods?                                         
Wolfgang U. Nickl,  ASML Holding N.V. - CFO, Executive VP & Member of the Management Board    [66]
                                        
Yes.",".

What is the rough rule of thumb for ASML's future periods?"
Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: The   first of all for everybody, we had 2 agreements with ZEISS: one was a high NA investment agreement and one was an equity agreement. The high NA one, obviously, goes through our R&D line and also through our balance sheet as it relates to the CapEx. But as it relates to the equity investment, you will see that equity method investment on the balance sheet of about EUR 1 billion for the 24.9% that we own, and then you see 2 elements in our financial statements. First of all, you see in the P&L a profit that's attributed to those 24.9%, and therefore, the first quarter, you saw a negative EUR 17 million. And the second thing that you see is in our cash flow from investing.",".

Question: What was the reason for the negative EUR 17 million in the first quarter?

Answer: The negative EUR 17 million in the first quarter was due to a decrease in the value of our equity investments."
Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: You see the dividend attributed to that investment, and you see that we received a dividend also for 3 months period of almost EUR 20 million. So the dividend is basically, since SMT basically distributes their earnings, a very good reflection of the profitability of that business. Now accounting makes this a little bit complicated because you need to do numerous things, but you start from a very healthy profit. And then you start off with, number one, the adjustment from IFRS to U.S. GAAP. Number two, you adjust for differences in accounting policies between the companies. But then number three is where it really hits you. Even though it's not an acquisition, you still need to do purchase price accounting. That means you need to write up the inventory to the fair market value. You need to identify intangibles.",".

Question: What is the purchase price accounting adjustment for ASML Holding NV?

Answer: The purchase price accounting adjustment for ASML Holding NV is the difference between the fair market value of the assets acquired and the amount paid to acquire the assets."
Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And then you do the same thing that what you have heard us talking about when we talked about HMI, you need to consume that inventory and you need to amortize these intangibles. And that takes your profit all the way to a EUR 17 million loss. Now as it relates to the future, this is something that will still be with us for a long time because these intangible has a lifetime of 15 years plus. But the inventory part, we will walk through within a year or so. So I think, net-net for 2018, this will still be a loss. And then in 2019, you will also see a profit on that line and then depreciate. And then the cash, of course, follows the true profit and cash flow of SMT.",".

Question: What is the lifetime of an intangible asset?

Answer: The lifetime of an intangible asset is typically 15 years plus."
Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And from a cash flow perspective, you should see a much, much higher number every year.

Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, CEO and President    [71]
                                        
All of them, because there will be   even if it's   we have the commitment to have all those tool ultimately to be at 251. But   so in fact, they're all at the 251 configuration.                                         
Robert Duncan Cobban Sanders,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director    [72]
                                        
I got it. So all of them will have an extra amount of money to be billed to the customer once you get up to 251 because that's beyond the spec, right?

No, because the spec is we need to do 251 to get the 125 wafers. So when we get over 251, we get more wafers out there, we get extra money. But 125 wafers is what we sold to them.                                         
Robert Duncan Cobban Sanders,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director    [74]
                                        
Okay. And just last question for Wolfgang, just on the gross margin in 2018. Given what you said about being higher than, I think, 45%, is 45% to 46% a kind of good model number for our models for 2018? You can just give us a vague range, that'd be great.

I think we would have [knocked] the result if it's only extremely marginal, but I don't want to tie it down to a specific number at this point either. So we'll go through the year. And the more important thing is it will be a good step forward towards the 50 plus in 2020. That's really what we're working for.

What is the company's outlook for the remainder of 2016?

Edited version Q4 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's fourth-quarter FY16 quarterly earnings conference call. 
This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations; and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. 
Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheet, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the financial information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and will discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise.","

Question: What is the non-GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016?
Answer: Non-GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders was $2.1 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. This compares to non-GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders of $2.0 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The increase in non-GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders was primarily due to higher revenue, partially offset by higher costs."
Edited version Q4 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis, unless stated otherwise. 
The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter of FY17. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. 
With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call, for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.","

What are forward-looking statements?

Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts and are generally, but not always, identified by the words ""expects,"" ""anticipates,"" ""plans,"" ""believes,"" ""intends,"" ""estimates,"" ""projects,"" ""will,"" ""should,"" ""could,"" or similar expressions. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, the following: our ability to compete in the rapidly changing technology environment; our ability to deliver on our guidance; the impact of global economic conditions; the impact of political and social conditions; our ability to maintain or improve our brand, image and reputation; our ability to protect our intellectual property; our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and executives; our ability to comply with governmental regulations; and other risks detailed from time to time in Cisco's filings with the SEC."
Edited version Q4 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: As a reminder, in Q2, on November 20, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP Video Connected Devices business, and accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q4 FY16. 
As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP, product orders and backlog information we will be discussing, is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q3 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way. 
So with that, I'll go ahead and turn it over to Chuck.",".

Thank you, Marilyn. We executed extremely well in Q4, with revenue growth of 2% and record non-GAAP EPS, which grew 9%. This was another strong quarter, wrapping up a great year. We closed out our fiscal year with $48.7 billion in revenue, up 3%, and non-GAAP EPS, which grew 8% to a record $2.36. Gross margins and operating margins were consistently strong throughout the year. We continue to manage our business well, and these results underscore our ability to execute against our strategic priorities and our rigorous discipline on profitability. 
Over this past fiscal year, we experienced a challenging environment with significant volatility. Our fourth quarter was no exception. After three consecutive quarters of growth, both Service Provider and Emerging Markets turned negative.",".

What was the main challenge in Q4?

The main challenge in Q4 was the volatility in the global economy."
Edited version Q4 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: Service Provider orders declined 5%, reflecting the many challenges in that customer segment that you've heard from our peers. 
In addition, Emerging Markets orders were down 6%. The remainder of the business remained healthy, with orders growing 5%. While the overall macro environment remains uncertain, we are well-positioned to capture the benefits of any tailwinds. 
At the same time, we're aggressively investing in priority areas to drive growth over the long term, regardless of the environment. We had strong performance in Security, Data Center, Switching, Collaboration and Services, as well as continued success in the transition of our business model to software and subscriptions. We remained focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we've made great progress over the past year in these priority areas, where we continue to see momentum. 
First, security.",".

As the global leader in networking, Cisco is uniquely positioned to deliver security at scale with leading-edge innovation, as we lead the transition to cloud-delivered security. Our team has done a phenomenal job of capitalizing on this distinct advantage that Cisco has in the most critical area for our customers. 
For example, we've been rapidly shifting our model from a primarily hardware business to a software and services business. This past quarter, we delivered our third-consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, with revenue up 16% and deferred revenue growing 29% as a result of this shift. 
We continue to add significant features and functionality to our security portfolio, both through internal innovation and M&A, to meet our customers' most pressing needs. Such as cloud Defense Orchestrator, which provides cloud-based security policy management.",".

Over the past year, we've demonstrated tremendous success in rapidly deploying Cisco's advanced threat solutions to our global customer base with our AMP solution, now deployed at over 17,000 customers around the world. 
As we have done in the advanced threat market, we are now deeply focused on winning in the next-generation firewall market. We launched our full-featured next-generation firewall in March, and we added over 6,000 customers this past quarter.

We are delivering technologies across physical, virtual and cloud-based deployments. In Q4, we launched our Tetration Analytics platform, providing complete visibility across the data center. Combining Tetration with Cisco Cloud Center, we can automate and orchestrate data center application workloads real-time between hybrid and private clouds, while enabling policy management with ACI. Our ACI family of products continued to see strong revenue growth in Q4, growing 36% at over a $2.3 billion annualized run rate.",".

Today's market requires Cisco and our customers to be decisive, move with greater speed, and drive more innovation than we've seen in our history. Today we announced a restructuring, enabling us to optimize our cost base and lower growth areas of our portfolio, and further invest in key priority areas, such as security, IoT, collaboration, next-generation data center, and cloud.

Edited version Q4 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: So when you look at, in Q4, what we obviously saw was, after three quarters of growth in the Service Provider and emerging countries, we saw those turn negative, as I said. And the rest of the business was up 5%, from an orders perspective. We also highlighted the fact that enterprise was up 3%. A little more color on that is that every geography around the world experienced positive enterprise growth. 
Commercial was up 5%. Every geography around the world experienced positive growth in commercial. And then in public sector, it was up 1% and I believe all except perhaps Europe were positive as well, in public sector. So outside of SP and emerging, we saw fairly consistent demand.

And then Simona, can you please ask your question?"

Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems Inc - CFO    [15]
                                        
Yes, so I'll start, and Chuck, you can jump in. But to your first question, the portion of our business that is recurring revenue is up to 28%, and that compares to 25% in Q4 of 2015. So we made really solid progress this year. 
In terms of the margins, this has been a huge focus for us all quarter long, and it is really great to see that we actually had our margins   gross margins and operating margins   up year over year for us this year. It's part of what we're driving in our shift to software.",".

1. What was the portion of Cisco's revenue that was recurring in Q4 2016? 
2. How did Cisco's gross and operating margins compare to Q4 2015?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: Those businesses have great margins, and it's part of the overall transition. In terms of, when do we change our model or our guidance, I think that will come over time as we make bigger shifts at the Company level. But that is our goal, as we shift to more software that have those nice, great margins.

The only other comment I'd make is that when we look at our success relative to subscription and software businesses, we have the product-deferred revenue that's associated with software and subscriptions, that we said was up 33%. We also have another category of total contract value that we have not recognized revenue on yet that we will be billing customers on, on a monthly basis going forward. 
We track both those numbers.",".

Question: What is the total contract value that Cisco Systems Inc will be billing customers on a monthly basis going forward?

I'll give a couple of macro comments here. So we obviously, are calling out the weakness we saw from a demand perspective in Q4 relative to SP and emerging countries. We also   obviously as we look forward, we're just uncertain how to model any improvement in those two, in particular, going forward. 
And the other issue is that there is some impact from the transition in our business model. I'll give you a quick example. We restructured and drove new value in how we put together certain Cisco One Software packages for our customers.",".

Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems Inc - CFO    [26]
                                        
Yes, and just on   the only thing to add to that   again, we base it on what we see, and again, we did see the additional slowdown in SP and emerging. That makes us a bit cautious. On the margins, Steve, we're going to be driving as much as we can in those margins, and we'll be working that.",".

Can you give us any sense, Chuck or Kelly, is there any benefit here from the early stages of the Ericsson relationship, allowing you to leverage that JV so that you can actually drive some of this restructuring?

Thank you.",".

Chuck Robbins, Cisco Systems Inc. - President and Chief Operating Officer 

Yes, we do believe that the early stages of our relationship with Ericsson have been helpful in terms of our ability to leverage that JV and drive some of the restructuring. We don't have any additional information to provide around incremental restructuring down the road."

On the Ericsson front, I'll tell you that the partnership continues to move forward, and there was really no correlation or discussion of the Ericsson partnership as it related to the decision on restructuring. We think that, again, that the original benefits that we saw with that partnership, with their global scale for services, their OSS capabilities, their radio expertise, combined with our IT expertise in data center and security, and other of capabilities, as well as the enterprise and IoT, were really the drivers there. So we see that continuing. 
As it relates to the cloud impact, I think when we look at sort of next-generation data center build-out in the private cloud, we look at our ACI portfolio, and we saw a $2.3 billion annualized business that grew 36%.",".

Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. So my first part is kind of on the product gross margin. So it looks like it was actually down sequentially in July, and I think that's primarily due to selling more switching and routing.

And then just one small one. What was the total acquisition revenue you guys got from all the acquisitions this quarter?

Hi, guys.",". 

What acquisition did Cisco make in the fourth quarter?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: I was hoping you could touch upon the activity you saw from some of your top cloud customers, to what degree you're continuing to see strength in that vertical? And then on the switching business, which saw a return to growth following several soft quarters, I was hoping you could help us understand to what extent ACI revenues are now greater than some of the legacy data center offerings? 
And presuming the mix of legacy in the data center is now smaller than ACI, would you expect the switching business overall to grow moving forward? Or are there offsets that could cause that to vacillate going forward?                                          
Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems Inc - CEO    [48]
                                        
Thanks, Jess.",".

Question: What is the CEO's view on the activity seen from some of Cisco's top cloud customers?
Answer: The CEO believes that the cloud market is continuing to grow and that this is good news for Cisco's customers."
Edited version Q4 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: On the web scale players, what we reported in the last couple of quarters was our top-10 web scale customers, and that business was up 2% this quarter. But it is a   when you have 10 customers in sort of a reporting segment like that, it's highly dependent upon ordering cycles. So I'm not concerned about our relevance or anything relative to that. 
On the switching business, I think it's important to understand a couple things. Number one, your question relative to the ACI portfolio, and has it exceeded the traditional portfolio, I think we   the answer to that is, yes. And our orders there were   I think grew in the data center switching business, were up mid single-digits.                                          
Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems Inc - CFO    [49]

On the revenue side. And so that transition continues to go well, and we see customers that are investing in new cloud-ready architectures, are choosing the ACI platforms, which is showing in the results. When you look at our overall switching portfolio, it's just important to understand the math on what percentage of that business is still attributed to our campus portfolio. 
And as we said, any time we have these macro   these environments where customers have any level of uncertainty, that tends to be an area that they will continue to sweat, if they can. And our job over the next several quarters is to drive innovation in that portfolio, integrate security more tightly, and again, focus on orchestration policy and helping our customers lower their costs.",".

Okay, great. I wanted to ask about long-term revenue growth. I think, Kelly, 3% to 6% has been discussed in the past, but with the shift to software and subscription, and service provider uncertainty, that seems like a stretch. And I'm not asking for specific guidance, but is there some direction that you would suggest for our long-term models?

Edited version Q4 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: If you go back to   I think that was back in June of 2015, was our last financial analyst conference, it has changed quite a bit. Our transition has accelerated, that we've been accelerating. And I'd say the other major change from that long-term guidance was certainly our expectation of the data center business, and that market has changed. 
So I'd say there is no long-term model change per se right now, but we're in the process of planning an analyst conference hopefully at the end of the calendar year here, and we'll update that. But I would say those are the two major assumption changes since we did that.

Great, thank you very much. I wanted to see if we could talk a little bit about longer term on the routing business, specifically. What you laid out sounds like very much the cyclical challenges facing your peers, as well as weak carrier CapEx. But if you could help us understand some of the longer-term themes around what's going on in routing, and how that sector may grow and your business may grow. And I'm pondering the implications around sort of SDN, as well as some of the architectural shifts of putting more of the burden into the optical space. Thank you.",".

What are the cyclical challenges facing your peers in routing, and how will that impact your business?
The cyclical challenges facing our peers in routing include weak carrier CapEx and increased competition. However, we believe that the routing sector will grow over the long term as more companies adopt cloud-based routing solutions and the demand for mobile and IoT services increases."

Yes, Simon, thanks for the question. When I think about routing, I actually think about it in several different ways. Number one, you've got the SP traditional portfolio with Edge access and core, which we discussed earlier, which is largely just a consumption-driven cycle that we go through. 
In the enterprise space, we have this transition to software-defined wide-area networking, which we're very well-positioned in right now with our IWAN portfolio. And we're actually working on a key differentiator for us, which I think is, as our teams have built out the ability to really drive the next-generation secure Edge.",":

1. What is Cisco's key differentiator in the enterprise space for its IWAN portfolio? 
2. What is Cisco's transition to software-defined wide-area networking?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: With our cloud security capabilities, the combination of dynamically provisioning those branch solutions, with the ability to have robust cloud security and Edge security, is going to be a real differentiator for us. So we see that being another opportunity for us going forward in the routing space. 
And then finally, when we talk about the security and the security-driven refresh of our core, in Q4 we actually had a couple of customers   I talked earlier in the opening comments about Stealthwatch Learning Networks. Which is effectively a machine-learning algorithm that runs at the edge of the network in the branch, and it actually does machine learning and a little bit of AI to determine normalcy for customers, and then flag for them when they see abnormal behavior going on.",".

What is the ""security-driven refresh of our core?""

This is a process where Cisco Systems Inc. updates its core products to include features that are designed to help protect customers from cyberattacks."
Edited version Q4 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: And we saw a couple of customers that actually made the decision to do a branch router refresh based on that capability, which we just launched in July. 
So we believe that there's innovation that we can bring that will lead us to a refresh opportunity in the core, and we think that's largely going to be driven around security. And we're seeing some real early examples. We need to see how it plays out, but we're seeing some early examples there. 
All right, Marilyn. Thank you very much. In wrapping up, I just want to summarize our priorities again as we think about the year ahead. First off, we're committed to executing against the financial model and against our priorities, regardless of the conditions of the market.",".

Thanks, Marilyn. We delivered a strong Q2 in a challenging macro environment. Recently, we've experienced one of the most volatile times in the global markets.",".

Question: What was the main driver of the company's strong performance in Q2? 
Answer: The main driver of our strong performance in Q2 was our continued execution of our strategy. We delivered on our commitments to customers and generated strong revenue growth across our businesses."
Edited version Q2 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: This volatility led to a slowdown in spending impacting our business especially during the last few weeks of January as we closed our quarter. Despite this slowdown, we executed very well with total revenue growth of 2% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 8%, strong margins and operating cash flow up 36%.

Collaboration grew 3%, driven by a 17% growth in WebEx, partially offset by some slowdown in our unified communications business. Deferred revenues showed continued strength growing 15%. 
Our data center decline of 3% was also driven by a slowdown in spend. In addition, we have tough comparisons from Q2 2015 when revenue grew 40%. UCS continues to be a strong franchise for us and is a foundational piece of our next-generation data center stack.",".

I would tell you that through the first 10 weeks of the quarter that was very much in line with what we expected. We were executing very much in line with how we would have expected the quarter to go. 
Our week 10   just so you have the data point was the end of the calendar year.",".

Edited version Q2 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call:  So, while a number of companies have reported earlier this year, not many have actually had their quarter end in January.  So, we ended at the end of the third week of January which we all know those first three weeks were reflective of the uncertainty that occurred in a lot of the financial markets. What I will tell you is that after week 10 through those three weeks, we saw customers as they were trying to digest what was going on. They paused a bit, and you see customers say   I want to just wait and see what is going on.  Let me take a look at this.  We want to understand this a little better.","

What caused the slowdown in Cisco's sales in the first three weeks of January?"

That is probably the extent that I can add to what we all know from what we're seeing every day. What I would tell you   and I will ask Kelly to comment on our guidance   is I would say that we took that feeling of those first three weeks into consideration as we built our guidance.

I think   to your question, Pierre. I think Chuck summarized it well. When we do our guidance, we look at everything we know at the time which is our funnel, the momentum we see, and everything else. I would say to put it in the words you use, I would say that our guidance is prudent. I think you see that we expanded our range to 3 points of range versus our normal 2 because I think it is more volatile than normal.

Vijay Bhagavath,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [6]
                                        
My question is around is Cisco a tale of two cities here?  We're seeing enterprise products turning light versus consensus while your service provider product   routing, video et cetera   are beating expectations. I would like to get your view on this enterprise versus service provider dichotomy, if any?  
And then, you have a bigger picture strategy around software and your cutting services fully believing that strategy and model.  My question is really around do you see IT spending queuing quickly toward OpEx versus the traditional CapEx model of spending?  How would Cisco [deliver] to this higher than usual OpEx IT spending moving forward?

Thanks, Vijay.",".

Question: How do you see Cisco's enterprise versus service provider dichotomy playing out in the future?
Answer: We believe that the enterprise market is growing faster than the service provider market, and we are seeing more and more customers moving to our products. This dichotomy will continue to play out in the future as customers move to our products for their specific needs."
Edited version Q2 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call:   I would say the initial question you asked relative to the difference between the enterprise and the service provider space, I think what we saw was that our customers were spending in areas that are incredibly mission-critical for them even in these times where there is uncertainty.  So, you see them continuing to spend in security.  You see them continuing to spend in the next-generation data center evolution which was indicative of the 100% growth we saw in that portion of our portfolio.  And, I think we saw customers where they had the option to wait, they chose to wait a bit.  So, I don't view it as   I don't see any fundamental issues relative to the enterprise portfolio or things like that.","

What areas of the enterprise portfolio saw 100% growth?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call:  I think that it was largely a prioritization effort that we saw within our customer base on the enterprise side. 
The service provider side, I think if you go back a couple of quarters, what I said was that our teams have been working hard to really get to alignment with our customers around the future of the industry, the future of their architectures.  How they were going to evolve to position them for the opportunities ahead, and I think we did that.  And, I would say that our teams have really executed well over the last couple of quarters as they align with our service providers on those priorities across the portfolio. We are pleased with where we are.",".

Question: What do you think is the biggest challenge facing Cisco Systems in the near future?
Answer: I think the biggest challenge facing Cisco Systems in the near future is continuing to align our customer base around the future of their architectures."
Edited version Q2 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call:  I don't think that if you really unpack those numbers over two or three quarters that you are going to see   you'd be able to delineate a whole lot between what went on with the exception of the enterprise customers prioritizing where they spent their money. 
As it relates to the OpEx versus CapEx move, I will ask Kelly and maybe she can comment on the software part of the question.  But, I didn't see any fundamental change this quarter in how our customers look at that versus what they have been doing for the last three, four, five, six quarters.  It's something that we deal with as it relates to   as an example, our collaboration portfolio, we made announcements last quarter that all of that portfolio, the entire portfolio, is now available.",".

Question: What was the main reason for the shift in OpEx spending this quarter?
Answer: The main reason for the shift in OpEx spending this quarter was due to the increased spending on our collaboration portfolio."
Edited version Q2 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call:  Or, we announced that it will be available to our customers from both an on-premise and a cloud-based perspective.

So, I'd say it is progressing well, and we're adding to our models with acquisitions like OpenDNS and Jasper which are both SaaS models.  We will continue to build that out as it becomes a bigger part of our portfolio. 
On the IT to OpEx, just to add to what Chuck said, I would say one thing that we have tremendous flexibility on is leveraging our great balance sheet to help provide solutions for whatever it is.  So, whether it is our Cisco capital offers or for the ability of us to build managed service as a service   those kind of offers.",".

Simona, on the 2%.  Great question.  Let me give a little context there.  Back   the last we had this was in Q3 of FY10, and it was about a 4% to 5% increase.",".

What is the increase in the 2% range this time around?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: I would say, what I've baked into my 2%   so it's roughly about $250 million to $275 million. What I've baked in the guidance is the incremental revenue I know that we will get from things like our services subscription businesses, our SaaS businesses, as well as some product flow-through on the distribution that we're seeing. That is what I baked into the guidance. 
I am not assuming there is going to be a lot more because of the current macro environment.  The sales guys are out there.  The teams driving to a monthly number and a quarterly number and given the spending constraints that we're seeing right now, I'm not being over-bullish in my guidance on that. That is how I built [that] up.",".

Simona, the second part of your question.  I think the word that we would use relative to how Kelly modeled in that would be the same that we talked about with Vijay which would be prudent. On the switching front from a revenue perspective, it was negative this quarter. We're trying not to give you lots of random pieces of information every quarter so that we can build some consistency in how you look at how we are performing.  But, I will tell you that on the new order side on the data center switching business this quarter we did see slightly positive growth on orders.",".

On the APJC recovery, the team there has done a great job. We've talked a lot about what we have seen happening in India.  We have seen tremendous success there.

I wanted to think a little bit ahead, Kelly, just given this extra week that you had in the guidance. Historically as you move into your fourth quarter, you typically post a solid sequential increase quarter over quarter.

Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [36]
                                        
On the extra week, this is how I think you can think about it.  I tried to be pretty transparent of what we are assuming in there so literally the $250 million or so, the $275 million that we're assuming literally is just the businesses where it is just because we have weekly billing it is going to amortize off our balance sheet.  That is basically a guarantee. Just marginally a little bit more for some of the distribution flow business.",".

What is the impact to Cisco Systems' near-term growth from transitioning more of its products into monthly billing models?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: I would say as you are modeling for Q4, I think you should assume the normal ranges.  Take that out   that $250 million to $275 million and assume the normal ranges of growth in Q4. 
On the software and SaaS.  I know you and others ask me this question a lot, and it is tough to quantify.  Certainly, it is 1 point or 2 easy to say, off the top. Some of the businesses we're growing   our businesses that we've had that are great like [collaboration] and security.  We are adding more to this profile with some of these different offers.  These big enterprise ELAs that we have. It is hard to quantify for any one quarter, right, of when it is going to fall in.","

What is the average revenue growth for your software and SaaS businesses?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call:  But, there is certainly something on the top line, but we will see that come back through as we continue to build that out and amortize it.

Quick clarification.  Strength in service provider video, I think you highlighted China. If you could just talk to what you think the duration is?  And then, in terms of market verticals, I was interested if you could talk a little bit more about your exposure to what we have often called Web 2.0 or web-scale operators?  Certainly, there is the idea that they buy white box, but we know you sell to them.",".

Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold asked about the strength of Cisco's service provider video business, the duration of that business, and the company's exposure to web-scale operators. Leopold also asked about Raymond James' view of Cisco's competitive position in the networking market."

Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [39]
                                        
Simon, thanks.  This is Chuck.  On the SP video front, I think that the team has done a great job of evolving that portfolio and really building some great solutions.  They're engaged with lots of customers. Our strategy when we divested of the video CPE business was to really focus on a cloud-based delivery model, and that is occurring.  We're having obviously good success with that platform in China. That tends to be an ongoing   a longer-term solution that the customers deploy.  So, we will see.  Again, we're taking things quarter by quarter, but we feel good about where they are there.",".

Q: What are your thoughts on the trends from that group of customers?
A: We feel good about where they are there."
Edited version Q2 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: 
On the second part of your question, relative to the web-scale guys.  We have talked the last couple of quarters about how we had been having success with them.  And, I talked about us really changing our strategy about 18 months ago and moving more into a collaborative, co-development mode with them thinking about what they're very unique needs are.  I will tell you that our business with them last quarter grew 17% so we continue to see relatively good strength with those customers.

Chuck, maybe just to go back to the data center, if we could.  I get the macro and the tough compares there."," that we might not have touched on. 

What is the company's strategy for generating revenue from its data center customers?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call:  Just looking more broadly at that market, I think though the share gains are starting to normalize a little bit at least in the server market.  So, when  you think about the continued growth on the hardware side of the data center, do you think we need to broaden the server offering?  Maybe get more involved in storage or ADC or some other products that are important to the data center that Cisco might not fully be participating in?

And, you can assume that we're looking at our role up and down that stack going forward. I would tell you that there was a recent article, I think late last week in InfoWorld where [Barry Sing] actually outlined how we are thinking about this market.  So, you are spot on, and we are spending a lot of time thinking through what role we play there and what the opportunity is.  But, we believe it is going to be significant. Appreciate the question.

I'm going to close with some short comments. I am incredibly pleased with how we executed this quarter, as I said, in a very uncertain macro environment.  Our teams did a great job, and as we look forward, I think about how we're operating the Company on these two fronts.  
The first front is that we will continue to execute and run this Company in a well-managed way even in challenging environments, but at the same time, we're going to move full speed ahead.",".

I believe we can do both.  I think that will allow us to take advantage of the incredible opportunity ahead of us, and I have a great deal of confidence in our ability to execute against that.

                                                   Thanks, Kim. 
Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's third-quarter FY16 quarterly conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO, and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. 
By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the financial information section of our Investor Relations website.",".
Question: What is the company's outlook for FY17?
Answer: Cisco Systems expects its full-year 2017 operating income to be in the range of $12.5 billion to $12.7 billion. This outlook reflects our current expectations for continued strong growth in both our enterprise and service provider businesses, as well as a modest decline in our consumer business. We continue to expect GAAP net income to be in the range of $11.5 billion to $11.7 billion and non-GAAP net income to be in the range of $11.0 billion to $11.3 billion."
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: 
Throughout this call we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll also discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise. 
The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. 
With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details.",".

What are forward-looking statements?

Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts and are generally, but not always, identified by the words ""expects,"" ""plans,"" ""anticipates,"" ""believes,"" ""intends,"" ""estimates,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" or ""should"" and similar expressions. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, the following: our ability to maintain or increase market share; our ability to successfully develop and market new products and services; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses; our ability to protect our intellectual property; our ability to attract and retain qualified employees; our ability to comply with governmental regulations; our ability to satisfy our debt obligations; our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations; our ability to obtain necessary financing; and other risks detailed from time to time in Cisco's filings with the SEC.

Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. 
As a reminder, in Q2 on November 20, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP video connected devices business, and, accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q3 FY16. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP video, CPE business from our historical results. 
We have provided historical financial information for the SP video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q2 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way.","

What is the impact of the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of the SP video connected devices business on Cisco's Q3 FY16 financial guidance?
The impact of the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of the SP video connected devices business on Cisco's Q3 FY16 financial guidance is that all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information Cisco will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP video, CPE business from its historical results."

                                                   Thank you, Marilyn. 
We delivered strong Q3 results against the back drop of a macro environment that continues to be uncertain. Despite this uncertainty we executed very well, with revenue growth of 3% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 6%. 
We continued to generate strong operating cash flow of over $3 billion in the quarter, returning nearly $2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our commitment to operating discipline continues to yield solid results in spite of the challenging environment. The operational changes we continue to make will further enable our customers to leverage the strategic role of the network as they transform their businesses to become digital.",".

Question: What was the main driver of revenue growth in Q3?
Answer: The main driver of revenue growth in Q3 was continued demand for our networking solutions from our customers in the enterprise and service provider markets."
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: 
As I did last quarter, I'd like to highlight our momentum in four key areas. First, in security, we saw continued acceleration in the third quarter with revenue growth of 17%, while deferred revenue grew 31% driven by our ongoing shift from hardware to more software and subscription services. 
Our security business is tracking as we indicated it would earlier in the year. As one of the largest IT security vendors, we believe our portfolio is the most comprehensive and effective in enabling our customers to protect their businesses. Security is and will remain one of our absolute highest priorities. 
Second, collaboration, revenue accelerated by 10% and deferred revenue here grew 16%. This is yet another example of a successful transition to a cloud-based platform, increasing our market leadership, which we expect will give us sustainable long-term differentiation.",".

What was the growth rate in security revenue in the third quarter?
17%"
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: 
Third, our next-generation data center portfolio is extremely well-positioned to meet our customers' needs regardless of where they place their work loads, enabling public, private or hybrid cloud employments. At our Partner Summit we received a very strong response to our innovations as customers adopt our next-generation data center solutions. Our strong position is evident in our install base of 52,000 UCS customers and the continued success of our ACI portfolio. 
In March we announced a dramatic improvement in price performance, and by this I mean 100-gig performance for 40-gig pricing, driven by new ASICs, which provide us a time to market advantage of 18 to 24 months, while maintaining the same margin profile.",".

What is the time to market advantage of 18 to 24 months for Cisco's new ASICs?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: In Q3, our ACI platform grew revenue approximately 100%, while it exceeded a $2 billion annualized run rate, far outpacing our next closest competitor in both size of business and growth rate. Our entry into the hyper-converged market with HyperFlex, as well as our acquisition of CliQr, an innovator in multi cloud orchestration to extend our leadership position in the data center. 
Finally, we continue to make great progress in transitioning more of our revenue to recurring, with increased emphasis on software and subscription offers. Our software subscription deferred revenue balance continues to exhibit accelerated growth, this quarter up 36%. 
We have a number of strong proof points for how we've executed successfully against our objective and the potential to apply the same model to the rest of our portfolio."," for each.

1. What is the ACI platform's revenue growth rate in Q3?
100%
2. What is the ACI platform's annualized run rate?
$2 billion
3. What is the hyper-converged market?

4. What is CliQr?

5. What is the deferred revenue balance for software subscriptions?

1. What is the ACI platform's revenue growth rate in Q3?
The ACI platform's revenue growth rate in Q3 was 100%.
2. What is the ACI platform's annualized run rate?
The ACI platform's annualized run rate is $2 billion.
3. What is the hyper-converged market?
The hyper-converged market is a market that is focused on the convergence of physical and virtual infrastructure.
4. What is CliQr?
CliQr is a company that specializes in multi cloud orchestration.
5. What is the deferred revenue balance for software subscriptions?
The deferred revenue balance for software subscriptions is $1.5 billion."
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: In addition to the success I've highlighted in our security and collaboration businesses, we had double-digit revenue growth again this quarter in Meraki, which stands out as an excellent example of how we've begun to scale our enterprise networking into a subscription model. 
As I look to the future, you will see us expand the approach we have taken with the success of Meraki, collaboration and security, and apply it to our data center and core networking for both enterprise and service providers. Our $180 billion of install base, with by far the most widely adopted operating systems for networking, makes us uniquely positioned to lead this migration. 
While the overall macro environment remains uncertain, we are nicely positioned to benefit from any rebound in the global economy.",".

What is the company's strategy for expanding its enterprise networking business into a subscription model?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: At the same time we will continue to manage our business to capitalize on the key growth areas in front of us. I'm very pleased with our demonstrated ability to execute operationally and strategically in virtually any environment. 
Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more details on our financials.                                          
Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [4]
                                                   Thanks, Chuck. 
I am pleased with our continued execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments, and delivering shareholder value. 
Starting with delivering profitable growth, total revenue was $12 billion, up 3%, with growth in product revenue of 1% and services of 11%. We did have an extra week in Q3.",".

Question: What was the main driver of growth in product revenue?
Answer: Product revenue growth was driven by continued growth in our core networking and collaboration products, as well as our security and automation solutions."
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: Consistent with our guidance for the quarter, the benefit to revenue was approximately $265 million, $200 million of which was from our services, subscription businesses, and $65 million from our SaaS businesses like WebEx, as well as some from our product distribution. 
In switching, as Chuck mentioned, we continue to see good momentum with ACI in the next-generation data center. The 3% decline in switching was mostly driven by macro-related weakness in our campus business, offset by positive growth in data center switching. 
Routing experienced 5% decline, mostly driven by the high end. We are seeing continued strength with our web-scale customers where our co-development continues and our sales to the top 10 web-scale customers was up 31%.

Let me quickly summarize before we move to questions. First, I think the number one key takeaway is that we continue to execute well, even in an obviously very tough environment. 
Secondly, we have proven our ability to transition certain elements of our portfolio, like we have done with Meraki security and collaboration, and we believe we can accelerate long-term growth by bringing this same approach to our core, and this process has begun. Finally, everything we do will be done through a lens of enabling our customer success while driving value for our shareholders.

                                                   Hi, thank you very much. I just wanted to clarify your guidance for the July quarter. How much of the revenues embedded in that guidance comes from acquisitions that closed in the last year, just so we can get a sense for the organic trends in the business. And then when we think about the 3% growth in bookings in the quarter, how much of that was benefited by the extra week in the quarter?                                          
Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc.",".                                                    

Q: And then just one follow-up on that. So, you said that the organic growth in bookings was 3%. Can you give us a sense of how much of that was due to the extra week in the quarter? 
A: So, we would expect that about 2/3 of that would be due to the extra week in the quarter."
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: - CFO    [3]
                                                   I'll answer the second part, first, Simona. In terms of how much benefit we got from the extra week, we don't think there's much. What we saw this quarter was the forecast was pretty straightforward. The team saw deal closure and conversion rates drag on, especially in the enterprise segment. And, quite, frankly the deals that we closed were more in line. So, we don't think we had any upside from the extra week in bookings sitting there. 
In terms of your first question on the acquisitions, we'll start to see   in the current run rate you have the bulk of, like OpenDNS and everything else.",".

What is the current run rate for acquisitions?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: For the new acquisitions that you don't have a full quarter in the run rate, we'll get a bit of a benefit from Jasper and Acano, but it is not terribly material in the overall growth rate.

                                                   Thanks, and congrats on great execution. First question is with regards to the data center. I hear your comments with regards to the macro impact on it, but it's five quarters in a row now where that business is stuck between the $800 million to $850 million in revenue. And this business has accounted for about one-third of your growth in the past few years. So, if you can us a little bit more color as to why isn't this moving, that would be great.",".

Operator

Thank you, Ittai. With respect to the data center, can you give us a little bit more color on why this business is not moving as fast as you would like? And then secondly, with respect to the acquisitions, can you give us a little bit more color on the impact of Jasper and Acano on the overall growth rate? Thank you.

Ittai Kidron, Oppenheimer & Co. - Analyst

Sure. So, with respect to the data center, we continue to see growth in the data center market, but it's not moving as fast as we would like. And with respect to the acquisitions, we think that Jasper and Acano will have a modest impact on the overall growth rate."
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: 
The second question with regards to the gross margins, I have to go back all the way to 2010 to find product gross margins that are equal to those that you just reported. Can you just give us a little bit more maybe of a framework to think about what is really changing in the portfolio, whether it be through mix or change in the competitive environment, anything that can justify the increase in gross margins and how sustainable you think that is.                                          
Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [6]
                                                   Ittai, this is Chuck. Thanks for the questions. I'll answer the first one and I'll give Kelly the gross margin question. 
As we look at the data center business we see a few things going on.",".

1. What is one reason for the increase in gross margins? 
The increase in gross margins is due to a number of factors, including mix changes, product innovation, and increased efficiency."
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: First of all, we think that there is an impact coming from the overall macro environment that is relatively undeniable. We also saw, as our peers have, some caution in, I would say, the CapEx spend in the SP space, and that was one of the segments that we saw weakness this quarter even with our data center portfolio. When we say data center in this context we're talking about UCS, in particular. 
The other thing that's going on is there is a transition going on in the data center relative to work loads. I talked a little bit about it on the last call. We see workload-specific use cases being deployed on high-performance blade systems like our classic UCS.",".

Question: What is the impact of the overall macro environment on Cisco Systems Inc's earnings?
Answer: Cisco Systems Inc sees an impact from the overall macro environment, which is relatively undeniable. Additionally, they saw weakness in CapEx spending in the SP space, which was one of the segments that they saw weakness this quarter."
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: Then we see also this move to hyper-converged systems, which led us to the launch of our HyperFlex platform last quarter. 
We also see a transition to rack-based systems which also result in stacks that are driven by container-based architectures. So in the past quarter 30% of our UCS business was actually from our rack portfolio, which we do have for the appropriate use cases. And you'll see us continue to expand our offerings. 
So we have UCS as a blade system. We have a rack version of UCS. We have HyperFlex in the market. And you'll see us continue to expand our portfolio to meet the evolving use cases in the data center. I think that's what's going on right now. 
Kelly, on the gross margin question?

                                                   On the gross margins, I would say, Ittai, it is a couple things. You're absolutely right when you go back and look historically. If you go back and normalize, the biggest thing that we did was obviously when we got out of the set-top box business. That helped us quite a bit. 
And normalized, if you go to just Q1 of this year we were at a 64.9%, and we even in last year we had 65.1%. So, I would say it is the new normal in that 63%, 64% range.",".

What was the biggest thing that Cisco Systems Inc did to improve gross margins in Q1 of this year?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: I would say the only other thing, when you go back and you update your models for the extra week   because a lot of the top line that I talked about comes off the balance sheet and there's no incremental costs   I did get a 0.5 point benefit just from the extra week in my gross margin. So, I would say a normalized view on the gross margin would have been closer to 64.5%.

And then, now that your security business honestly is starting to turn the corner, especially versus the peer plays, would you double down on security investments both organically and [a money]? Thanks.                                          
Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [10]
                                                   Vijay, I think the number one thing that I am feeling very positive about right now is, again, we have shown that we can drive the transition in our collaboration portfolio, which when you see that business over the last two years, the team has done a great job of transitioning it to a portfolio that is available to our customers as cloud-based services, and seeing it growing double digits and also growing our deferred revenue balance up 16%.",".

Question: What are your thoughts on new product refresh opportunities?
Answer: We are really excited about the new product refresh opportunities that we have in our collaboration portfolio. We have seen a great transition to a portfolio that is available as cloud-based services, and we are seeing it grow double digits and also growing our deferred revenue balance."
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: I think that's one example. 
In security, 46% of our business now comes from software and subscription services, which is clearly the direction that we had indicated we were going to take it, at the same time growing 17%. Our Meraki business, which really shows the evolution of networking to cloud-based management and policy, is over $1 billion now and growing double digits. And I think the thing I'm most excited about longer term is that we see a path to deploying that model across the rest of our portfolio. And, again, that work has begun. 
I think in the near term we see, obviously a mix of a pretty cautious environment still, because we do see customers spending where they need to spend. But don't misunderstand, there is still a fair amount of caution in the market.",".

What is the growth rate for Meraki?
The growth rate for Meraki is over 20%."
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: But I think that we've executed well this quarter. We had five of our seven product categories that were in positive growth, with three of those in double-digits. We had all the geos in positive growth from an order perspective. And we saw pretty good strength across our segments. So that's the first question. 
The second one relative to security, the answer is yes, yes, and yes. We will continue investing both organically and any other way that we see appropriate to drive that architecture. The team has done a phenomenal job.

Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: How concerned are you about that? Do you think your new product portfolio is yet to impact that? Do you believe your losing share or it's the markets? And then, finally, what is the impact on your services businesses, in other words, how much of that is maintenance that could be impacted by declining hardware?                                          
Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [13]
                                                   Let me take the first one and then, Kelly, you can maybe make a connection from the services to the hardware. On the switching business I'll point out a couple things. Last quarter we indicated that our campus switching business, the growth there is largely driven by refresh, which in an uncertain time, enterprises that have infrastructure that's functioning for them, they're not going to make the move to upgrade.",".

Q: What is the impact on your services businesses, in other words, how much of that is maintenance that could be impacted by declining hardware?
A: We're seeing a decline in hardware sales, but we're seeing growth in services. So, it's a mix of both hardware and services."
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: So, we see a pause in that refresh cycle, which we talked about last quarter, and nothing really changed there. 
What we did see is we saw our data center switching revenue growth increase. And the other thing that I'll point out is that we had indicated that we believe that our data center switching growth   the new product portfolio would surpass the declines of the traditional products that we've had. And our order growth rate, which we haven't put in any of the documentation, our order growth rate this past quarter on that $4 billion portfolio was double digits. 
So we're pleased with the progress that we have made in the data center switching space. And, again, that's $4 billion and it grew double digits in orders. So, we feel okay about that.",".

Question: What is the order growth rate for the $4 billion data center switching portfolio?
Answer: The order growth rate for the $4 billion data center switching portfolio was double digits."
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: On the routing front it's a combination of things, I think that there's certainly  $1 billion in the quarter, $4 billion in annualized run rate on the data center switching   Kelly is making sure we're clear. 
On the routing business, we've seen a few things. Clearly there is a macro issue that we're dealing with. We also saw, again, as you heard from some of our peers, we saw some increased caution in the service provider space. We saw slow movement in the core of those networks   flattish activity at the edge. 
And we do have a number of new platforms that are in certification with several of the key players that we, at some point in the coming quarters, we would expect those to begin to show up favorably. But that's what we see right now.",".

                                                   And then in terms of, Steve, your question on impact on the services business, typically for new sockets there would be a little lag for that. But I will say that our service business has been laser focused on driving renewals. So, even if enterprises are holding on to their switches and routers longer, our services team and sales team has been very focused on getting the contracts renewed. And we're seeing that pay dividends with the acceleration of growth. 
Again, if you normalize our service revenue growth this quarter for the extra week, they still grew 4%, which is up from 3% year-over-year growth in Q2 and it was 1% in Q1. So, we're really starting to get traction there.

                                                   Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Jim. Again, the thing to keep in mind   true, we did guide with the extra week which came in, in line   but just, again, a couple things. When we guide we tend to have a little conservatism in the gross margin rate.",".

1. What was the reason for the guidance being higher than previously reported gross margins?

Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: But take off that 0.5 points, we're still parked at the 64.5% range. 
We do have normal seasonality quarter in and quarter out. So, always Q1 and Q3 are our strongest gross margin quarters, and Q2 and Q4 are weaker, and it is typically driven by our mix, especially mix of servers in those two quarters. That is also a driver. 
And I think, just operationally speaking, again, the teams are doing a very good job from a productivity perspective in terms of driving costs out of the product. We had a lot of efficiencies out of the supply chain in terms of managing our freight and our inventory management. So, I would say there has just been real   we had a very strong quarter from operational excellence.",".

Question: What are the main drivers of your gross margin?
Answer: The main drivers of our gross margin are our mix of servers, especially mix of servers in our Q1 and Q3 quarters, and our productivity from our teams."

If I look at pricing this quarter we are being very disciplined on pricing. We're starting to see a tiny bit of a tick up, and you'll see that in our Q, where the impact to our gross margin rate year to date is about 2.2 points and Q3 was 2.4. So, still strong but we are still seeing price erosion. But, again, the strength we're seeing this quarter mostly came from just improvements in productivity.

And, lastly, could you help us quantify any of the macro impact?

You've got me covered there. Of our massively scalable data center customers, of that amount more than half of it is certainly switching, and then the next biggest follower is routing. So, it's more than 50%, significantly more than 50% is our switching products. 
To your point on then, you inferred   what does it mean that switching overall was down 3%. I just want to reiterate.

These web-scale customers are definitely in our service provider segment, which was flat overall for the quarter from a bookings perspective. On the rest of the portfolio, to your question on service provider, we're seeing, again, the slowdown from just the overall service provider CapEx spend.

I also think that there is still a small percentage of the overall SP business as it relates, which is you'll see flat when the segment was up 31% given the size of the business. But obviously, you could have done that math. But I do think that our teams have done a really good job here. 
Kelly, the other question, the third portion of the question, was that relative to any revenue impact in Q4 that we have built into the guidance relative to the macro environment, just generically we are not modeling any improvement, I think is the safest way to say it.

I get there was a clear benefit of an extra week but this now marks, I think, the second quarter in a row of upside coming from the services segment. I imagine most of the return of double-digit growth was the extra week. My question is, are you seeing a broader increase in services driven by digitization or solutions selling trends? And if so, do you expect the services recovery to potentially be a leading indicator for a future product recovery?

Answer: We expect services revenue growth to continue in the near term as we benefit from an extra week of sales. However, we do not expect this growth to be as strong as it was in the first quarter of the year."
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: Let me, first of all, say that I think over the last few quarters Joe Cozzolino and his team have been incredibly focussed on driving the operational excellence around the P&L element of that, which is what you have seen with the gross margins, and I think some of the discussion I had earlier around the focus on the renewal capability. I think we're seeing general improvement in the execution there. 
We see advance services obviously doing reasonably well; security services doing reasonably well. And then, as I mentioned earlier, the renewal activity, our teams did a better job this past quarter. So, I think a lot of what you're seeing is operational discipline and execution, to be honest.","

If you look at what we declared and we stated our strategy is around cloud, it really is focused on enabling what we believe is going to be the long-term desire of our customers, which is to operate in a hybrid cloud model.

We also said that we were going to transition our portfolio to be cloud-delivered and as a service, delivered where it makes sense, and over time across the entire portfolio. And you've seen us do that with our continued growth in Meraki in collaboration and security. And now the plans are actually under way on a project to deploy that across the rest of our portfolio, although it's early days. I think when you look at deferred revenue of 36% on the balance sheet, that says that we're being successful in that second pillar.",".

And then the third pillar was to help our customers with the infrastructure needed to actually take advantage of both private and public clouds or enabling hybrid. And when you look at the data center switching portfolio on an annualized $4 billion business, with new orders growing in double digits, I think that customers are driving both. And I think that the three pillars of that strategy are working. 
As far as gross margins when we sell to private cloud versus public cloud, Kelly, can you comment there?

                                                   Yes. I'd say we obviously have different margin profiles within both.

We're in a good position as a strategic buyer with some of the challenges in the public market and some of the valuations becoming a little more realistic. 
What I suggest to you, that over the next 12 months we'll be quite as active as we have been in the last 12. I probably wouldn't expect it to be quite as fast-paced as it has been but we will continue to be opportunistic around the areas of growth that are important to our future.

We saw our enterprise customers, in particular, really put the brakes on because they were just completely unsure of what was going to transpire. And I think that led us to a very cautious tone. So, that would be the number one reason why we were more cautious then.","

1. What was the main reason for Cisco Systems Inc's cautious tone during its last earnings call?
2. How did Cisco Systems Inc's enterprise customers react to the stock market's wild swings in late January?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: 
I just want to make sure that we are balanced here, that while we're optimistic and we're pleased with our execution, we still are operating in a relatively uncertain environment. We got the Brexit coming up, the vote coming up in June. We've got the news out of the Fed today. We've got all the election dynamics. We got issues in Brazil, we've got geopolitical dynamics. 
So there is a relatively broad set of unknown issues out there. So, we're still operating in an uncertain environment. But I think the stock market issue and the timing of the end of our last quarter would probably be the biggest difference.

                                                   Great. Thank you. I wanted to go back to the web-scale vertical a bit.",".

What is the biggest difference between now and the end of the last quarter?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: I know that is beating a dead horse a little on this call. But I wanted to see if you could talk about the bigger trend around the white box competitive threat, because it seems apparent that there is not the dramatic shift to white box that many had feared. But maybe it has yet to happen. So if you could talk how you're countering the threat or the substitution effect of those web-scale customers building or buying unbranded switches, rather than your products. Thank you.                                          
Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [52]
                                                   Yes, Simon, it's a good question. I think that there's a misconception about what's driving this belief that all the customers want to buy white box switching.",".

What is driving the belief that all the customers want to buy white box switching?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: And I think this is in the same vein of   it is all about cloud, or all about SDN, or all about white box. None of these customers are fundamentally chasing a technology trend. There are underlying business drivers that are leading them to these solutions. 
So, what we've been doing is focusing on attacking the business driver and not so much the technology trend that everybody writes about. In the case of the web-scale players, what they're looking at is, they're looking for significant automation. They're looking for the ability to run massive data centers at huge scale, very low cost, with a ton of automation, which over time will become the norm, I think, for all customers.",".

Question: What are the underlying business drivers that are leading web-scale players to seek significant automation?
Answer: The web-scale players are looking for significant automation in order to achieve massive data center scale, low cost, and a ton of automation."
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: There is this massive focus on operational expense reduction, which is all around automation, programmability, which is where we are headed with our core platforms in the enterprise, as well. 
So, what we did is we built some really aggressive products. Our teams, again the ASICs improvements that have been built that give us the advantage on the price performance, and then enabling our portfolio to fit within the operational environments of these customers, I think, has been the key. 
That's where what they're looking for. They're not singularly focused on white box. They're looking at how do they solve that problem. And we're just spending more time with them to really understand what they need and how we can fit their requirements.",".

What are the key areas of focus for Cisco Systems Inc. in terms of operational expense reduction?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: And you're going to see us continue to evolve our portfolio in whatever way we need to, to make sure that we remain relevant there.

                                                   I'm wondering if you could walk us through what you've seen so far with the Inspur relationship in China. I see China revenue decelerated but it still grew very strongly at 22%. And also the Ericsson relationship   it sounds like you've got some big deals in the quarter, or a few deals in the quarter. Maybe just highlight if you feel like that relationship is still on track for this $1 billion by 2018. The reason I ask, obviously Ericsson had a very soft March quarter.

What are your thoughts on the Inspur relationship in China?
The relationship with Inspur is still on track for $1 billion in 2018."
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: I actually didn't expect anyone to highlight the fact that our China was decelerating, as our third quarter of really solid growth in China. I will point out that, that is across the board, it is across the portfolio. The team has done an amazing job there. I've spent a fair amount of time over there and I think that we're really pleased with where we are in China right now, in the midst of the uncertainty that's being discussed in the marketplace. 
On the Inspur partnership, in September we signed the MOU, which was basically a letter of intent to formulate the venture. I was over there three weeks ago where we formalized the term sheet basically, and we're in the final stages of getting that one put together.","

Q: Can you give us an update on the Inspur partnership?
A: We're in the final stages of getting that one put together."
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: I would expect that we'll be in market sometime in the fall with some of the early products and solutions with them. We're spending a lot of time with them right now. So I think late this year is when we'll begin to see some early results from that. 
I think on the Ericsson front, any time you do these really large partnerships, they always take a little longer probably than we would all hope, but we're very optimistic. We've spent a ton of time together. I think on the last call we talked about the number of joint solutions within the first 100 days that we actually had on display together at Mobile World Congress, which was pretty amazing.",".

Question: What are some of the early products and solutions with Ericsson that you're working on?
Answer: We're spending a lot of time with them right now. So I think late this year is when we'll begin to see some early results from that."
Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: And then this past quarter we saw 17 transactions close between our teams, in the midst of a time where Hans is doing a pretty significant organizational restructuring and our teams are getting to know each other. We'd all want it to go faster but we're pretty pleased where that partnership is right now.

It is a challenging environment out there and I think that our teams have proven that we continue to execute regardless of the environment we face. 
As I said last call, we're running the Company on two fronts. We're focused on the execution and operational excellence, and at the same time we're focused on transitioning our business and investing in the future, which I think was displayed by our progress in the different areas that I highlighted during the call today. 
I think that, again, if you look at our success in security and collaboration, next-gen data center, the Meraki cloud networking platform, and overall in our transition to software and subscription; I think we're on that journey.",".

Thanks, Sam. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's first-quarter FY17 quarterly conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO, and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. 
By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding Webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. 
Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found on a financial information section of our Investor Relations website.",".

Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: What is the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information?
The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is a reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and other non-cash expenses."
Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: As is customary in Q1, we have made certain reclassifications to our prior-period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation.

Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we will discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparison throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis unless stated other wise. 
The matters we will be discussing include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter of FY17.",".

What are the forward-looking statements in this earnings call?

The forward-looking statements in this earnings call include guidance for the second quarter of FY17."
Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent annual report on form 10-K, which identifies important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. 
With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. 
As a reminder in Q2 FY16, on November 20, 2015, we completed the sale of the Customer Premises Equipment portion of our SP Video Connected Devises business and accordingly had no revenue or expense from that business in Q1 FY17.","

What is the main risk factor that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements?
The main risk factor that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements is the risk that we may not be able to successfully execute our strategy or that our strategy may not be successful."
Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from our historical results. 
We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q4 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way. 
With that, I'll go ahead and turn it over to you, Chuck.

Thank you, Marilyn. 
We delivered a strong Q1 in an environment that continues to be challenging.",".

Question: What was the main driver of Cisco's Q1 2017 earnings? 
Answer: The main driver of Cisco's Q1 2017 earnings was the continued growth of its core businesses."
Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: We executed very well in the quarter, with revenue growing 1% and non-GAAP earnings per share growing 3%, along with continued strength in non-GAAP gross and operating margins. This quarter total product orders declined 2%, largely due to Service Provider orders declining 12%, which was worse than our expectations heading into the quarter. 
We continued to show great product in how we are aligning our business model to the way our customers want to consume Cisco technology. There are many strong indicators that we are driving this change, including the 48% growth in our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscriptions. At the same time, we are delivering more innovation with simple, intelligent automated solutions with industry-leading security across our portfolio. 
Let me review a few areas of our business where our innovation is driving momentum."," for each.

1. What was the main reason for the decline in total product orders in the quarter?
2. What is the growth rate of deferred revenue related to recurring software and subscriptions?
3. What are some of the areas where Cisco is driving innovation?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: First, security. Our security revenue grew 11%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. We're driving more subscription-based recurring business, resulting in deferred revenue growth of 39%. 
Our competitive position in security is growing stronger, as our integrated architecture approach and best-of-breed portfolio resonates with our customers. In fact, we're the only company with security product revenue exceeding a $2 billion annualized run rate with double-digit growth. I'm incredibly pleased with how the team has transformed this business from where we were just a few years ago, establishing Cisco as the market leader in the most critical priority area for our customers. 
This past quarter, we again drove rapid adoption of our advanced threat solutions, with AMP revenue growing over 70% and now deployed at over 22,000 customers globally.",".

What is the market share of Cisco in security?
The market share of Cisco in security is the only company with security product revenue exceeding a $2 billion annualized run rate with double-digit growth."

Going forward, we are driving innovation, as we extend our security architecture from the network to the endpoint to the cloud. Over two weeks ago at our partner summit, we launched our enhanced AMP for Endpoints, a SaaS-based cloud managed security solution combining prevention, detection and response capabilities delivering simplified and effective endpoint security through our threat-centric architecture. 
Second, our next-generation data center, our goal is to build the best private and hybrid cloud solutions for our customers. We are investing heavily in our data center portfolio to extend our market leadership.",".

The total number of customers that Cisco has for its next-generation firewall is approximately 62,000."
Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: To do this, we are delivering software, hardware and systems at all levels of the data center stack and across delivery models. Our customers' widespread adoption of Cisco's ACI family of data center networking products continued in Q1, with revenue growth of 33% to an annualized revenue run rate now of $3 billion. 
The automation of data center networks that ACI delivers is the first step in enabling our customers to move work loads in and out of public cloud environments, while maintaining enterprise security and policy. We are building on the foundation of ACI by extending our capabilities with analytics through tetration, agnostic cloud management with cloud center from our CliQr  acquisition and our hyper converge offering, HyperFlex.

We expanded our profitability year over year, with increases in both non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margins. 
Let me provide some details on revenue. Total product revenue was down 1%. We saw switching decline 7%, driven by weakness in campus, partially offset by continued strong momentum in ACI, which was up 33%, as Chuck mentioned.

Chuck, I want to talk a little bit about the product mix between the divisions. The switching results are very disappointing. Clearly the wireless is now declining. Data center, and I have been asking you about data center for three quarters in a row and it's still not delivering and you've had changes in the leadership over there as well, which suggests still not where it needs to be.",".

Chuck, can you talk about the product mix between the divisions and what you're doing to improve it?"

These are key major areas for you and we're seeing revenue decline. Help us understand kind of a little bit of what's going on under the surface here and what is it that makes you feel comfortable that there's no big problem.

Hey, Ittai, thanks for the question. Let me hit a few of those areas. Let me first just acknowledge that there are always areas we can execute more effectively. We are working right now, the teams have been working over the last year on innovation in many of the areas you mentioned and again, I'm optimistic about the pipeline of innovation we have right now. 
I think when you look at the switching portfolio for us, back in January, when we saw the real market declines at that time and we called out the first pause we saw in the enterprise campus refresh, it's just basically maintained. It stayed the same way throughout the year.",".

Q: Can you give us an update on the enterprise campus refresh?
A: We're seeing a pause in the enterprise campus refresh."
Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: I'm pretty comfortable with our position there and as we continue to work on bringing automation and security and cloud-based management to the rest of the portfolio, I think that, that will help our customers see the opportunity to refresh. 
For me, it's really about as we look at the key driver of refresh over the longer term in the campus, I think that it's going to be really around automation, which can substantially reduce the operating expenses for our customers, as well as security into the network and analytics out of the network.","

On the wireless front, there are really, I think there are two key drivers there.","

What are the two key drivers for Cisco's wireless business?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: First of all is the market is transitioning to a controller-less architecture, so in large part, our access points were actually positive but the controller side of that business was down, Meraki was positive, and then also we are a pretty substantial recipient to the e-rate business, so as that has moved out much more slowly than expected, I think that, that has also impacted that business. Hopefully that gives you some color around those areas.

Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: That business is large account driven. You can assume that we have done an account by account by account analysis in that space and understand what's going on there. Right now I think there are a unique set of characteristics, particularly in the SP space. You have the overarching macro uncertainty in the economy, which I think has lead to the SP CapEx weakness that's been reported all year by the analysts, as well as you have political and regulatory environments that are somewhat uncertain, both in the US and around the world. 
Some of those could turn more favorable. Some of those could remain negative. We're just not going to model any improvement there and that's the real reason for the guide, just to be clear on that.",".

No, I agree. To address where we're investing the most, because no matter what the economy we're going to be investing for the future. I'd say it's in the same areas we have been. We are continuing to invest heavily in security. We think there's a lot of room to run there.",".

For sure security, data centers a focus for us and Chuck mentioned some of the innovation we have with the data center but also with the analytics around that. Then even in the core we're investing. Chuck talked about how we're driving automation and things along those lines. We're putting heavily our investment there as we drive innovation that you'll see today as well as going forward the next few quarters.

Hi, Chuck, Kelly and Marilyn. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to dig a bit into your deferred product revenues this quarter that have increased I think by a bit more than $1 billion year on year and actually $700 million or so, almost $700 million sequentially. It's a very impressive performance. The question I have is how do I take that into account when I look at your overall product performance that you had (inaudible) revenues slightly down in the quarter, but I would assume that a lot of that is related to the transition towards your subscription business. Do you have an estimate as how much this transition has impacted your number this quarter? Then of course I have the same question for next quarter.",".

Hi, Pierre. Thanks for the question. We actually deferred $1 billion in product revenues this quarter, which is a bit more than last quarter and $700 million sequentially.

For example, just using Cisco ONE as an example in this quarter, it would have been a point and a half just on that if we had recognized it perpetually like we had a year ago. 
It's for sure about at least two points and clearly that continues to grow and accelerate, so you can assume we're assuming that in my guidance.",".

Thanks, Simona. I'll let Kelly keep me honest on this, but I think our routing revenue that we reported in Q1 was 6% positive, so if that's incorrect we need to fix that.",".

Question: What other products within that Service Provider vertical accounted for the weakness?
Answer: The weakness in routing revenue was due to a decline in service provider revenue."
Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: On the guide, what I believe is that the predominant reason for the guide down is this Service Provider space. It's 25% of our business, roughly, and it was down 12% in new orders. You guys know the content of our revenue that is from current quarter bookings so the forecast this past quarter and the performance was negative 12% and we're just not modeling, right now, any improvement. You've written some great stuff around the SP CapEx environment, so I think you know it as well as anyone. 
While there is some forward-looking optimism, many of those cases there's money being spent on density and mobile networks in areas that we may not be a direct recipient as well as we also know there's a lot of variability in how the actuals actually play out vis-a-vis the forecast.","

One other comment or two. When I talk about customers that we saw just fundamentally freeze CapEx, some of those did it for their own earnings requirements. Some of it did it   we have examples that occurred based on currency challenges, FX issues.

Thank you very much. I wanted to ask just around the security business. Obviously, as been pointed out, is that it's developing pretty well, but I'm wondering two things. First, the pace of acquisitions, and specifically what looked to be tuck-in acquisitions, seemed to have slowed a little bit this quarter versus what it had been running. I'm just wondering if you're feeling like you've got the portfolio and the technology where you need it or should we expect to see acquisitions continue to run pretty high and that perhaps those reaccelerate.

Or is there anything that you can do on the product side that will get you closer? I want to ask it in the context of switching given that you had a major overhaul or major upgrade to your switching in the last two years, but we haven't seen the growth rates improving that dramatically.",".

Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [45]
                                            
Yes. We continue to see good demand for our switching products and we are seeing good growth in our switching business. We are seeing good growth in our switching revenue and our switching operating income. We continue to see good demand for our switching products and we are seeing good growth in our switching business."

Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [45]
                                        
I think that's a great question. I'd say   let's just talk about switching. I'd say for campus switching, which is 2/3, roughly, of our entire switching business, which is our biggest business unit, I'd say most of that is macro, right? It is the one area, and I think we've talked about before. It's the one area that people can put off doing a refresh if there is any macro concerns. That's what we typically see any time you see any economic pause or macro event. I do truly feel that if the optimism we've seen this week in the stock market continues giving that feeling of optimism in the economy, I would expect that to raise all boats in our campus switching side.",".

What is the one area that people can put off doing a refresh if there is any macro concerns?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: 
I'd say on the data center, you understand the dynamic there, right? To your point, we launched a fantastic product a couple years ago but we had to manage through the transition of a very sizeable legacy business data center portfolio declining as that accelerated and so we managed through that. Again, that business has continued to grow as we go through that intersection and cross through now as the legacy piece we've worked largely through. I'd say that's why I say it's largely macro, especially on the campus side.

What is the company's strategy for managing its legacy data center portfolio?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: I wanted to swift gears and talk about the balance sheet, if I could. Obviously, you and many other companies in tech space have been advocating for repatriation for a decade, a very long time. Could you help us understand or remind us where you would like to take that money, should you bring it back to the US? The second part of that question is there's some sentiment that investment, or I'm sorry, interest rates will start heading north again. Do you take that into account when considering your dividend policy? Thank you.

Jeff, so great question. I love balance sheet questions, actually. Yes, I mean again, we have talked about tax reform for a very long time.",".

Now, it's very early and we don't really know the details besides what his platform was during his campaign, so we're going to watch it very closely and look forward to as the details flush out there.","

What is Cisco Systems Inc's expectation for the incoming Trump administration's priorities in terms of technology?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: 
Just high level, as you could imagine, we have many, many scenarios of what we would do when repatriation comes, which is a combination of obviously we would ring fence in our debt and then we would have a blend of actions we can certainly take with our dividend as well as our share buyback, as well as leading flexibility for us to be able to do M&A and strategic investments. It'd be a combination of all those things. Obviously we listen very closely to our shareholders and how we want to do that and we recognize it will certainly give us a lot more flexibility.

What is the company's plan for repatriating cash from abroad?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: On the interest rates, would it affect our dividend policy? Again, we've been committed to growing our dividend with our earnings and again driving that to a great yield as our EPS grows. Interest rates go up, they go down.

What is the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP financial results?

They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.

What are forward-looking statements?

Our results demonstrate solid execution against our strategic priorities, accelerating our pace of innovation, increasing the value of the network and delivering technology in the way our customers want to consume it. 
In June, we announced a new era of networking with the launch of the network intuitive. This is an example of the industry-leading innovation Cisco is providing to its customers.",".

What was the network intuitive?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: The network intuitive is a new intent-based network that creates a fully integrated, intuitive system that is designed to anticipate actions, stop security threats in their tracks and continue to evolve and learn over time. We're applying the latest technologies, such as machine learning and advanced analytics, to operate and define the network.
From a security standpoint, the new network enables our customers to detect threats in encrypted traffic with unprecedented accuracy using Cisco's Encrypted Traffic Analytics and intelligence from Cisco's Talos cyber intelligence unit. We have created the only network that is designed for security while maintaining privacy, solving a previously unsolvable problem. 
Our new Catalyst 9000 switches represent the foundation of our intent-based networking capabilities and provide highly differentiated advancements in security, programmability, performance and lower operating costs by innovating at the hardware and software layer.",".

Customer reception to this new innovation has been incredibly positive. As we've always said, transitions of this nature are multiyear, but during the first 4 weeks in the market, our pipeline and product orders are strong with over 200 customers having ordered the new Catalyst 9000, the heart of the network intuitive platform. Our software value proposition in this portfolio is also compelling as the large majority of our customers are adopting the most advanced subscription offer available. 
Building on this early success, we intend to further accelerate our leadership in intent-based networking through the combination of our expertise in network infrastructure, AppDynamics visibility into applications and Viptela's automation capabilities.",".

What is the new innovation that has received positive customer reception?
What are the benefits of this new innovation?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: 
I believe that, over the next several years, we will see continued increasing relevance of technology as customers add billions of new connections to their enterprises. The network has never been more critical to business success, and we're looking forward to helping our customers take advantage of the insights and intelligence that are only accessible through our highly differentiated platforms.
In Q4, we also announced an extension of our strategic partnerships with Apple, IBM and Microsoft. We plan to deliver the first enterprise security application on Apple iOS, and we're integrating our comprehensive security portfolio with IBM's Cognitive Security operations platform. Additionally, we're collaborating with Microsoft in 2 important ways.",".

What is the first enterprise security application that Cisco plans to release on Apple iOS?"

Second, we're collaborating together to enable businesses to build and host their IoT applications in Microsoft Azure while extending the power of those applications to the Edge via Cisco's leading fog computing solutions. 
Now let's review other key parts of our business, starting with Security. We believe we are well positioned as the #1 enterprise security vendor. With growing cyberattacks and the need for our customers to protect their business-critical data and applications, we are aggressively providing security everywhere: in the network, in the cloud and at the endpoint.",".

What is the software layer on switches that Microsoft will be able to run on?

Our Security business delivered a solid quarter with double-digit orders and 49% deferred revenue growth. This caps off a year in which we delivered 9% revenue growth with more than $2 billion in revenue, making us the only company growing at this scale. 
Our leadership position in network security continues to expand, driven by our next-generation firewall portfolio with over 6,000 new customers added in the quarter, which is 3x our nearest competitor, bringing our total customer base to nearly 80,000.

                                                   Okay. So Ittai, let me touch on the Switching situation. First of all, the results we saw this quarter were not a surprise to us. If you think about our guide last quarter, we anticipated this. And we also knew at the time that we're going to be making the announcement in June about the new platform. And so we anticipated these results. Now anytime we do a major platform announcement, particularly in Switching, there is a period of time where our customers pause because they want to understand what this means. So we did see a pause, and we actually anticipated it. But we saw great traction with the new platform.",".

Q: What was the pause in Switching sales due to?
A: The pause in Switching sales was due to customers wanting to understand what the new platform meant."
Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: As I said earlier, just in the 4 weeks where we closed the quarter, we had 200 customers that embraced this new architecture and purchased the new Catalyst 9000 platform. And as I said in the opening comments, the great majority of them also opted for the advanced software subscription that goes on top of it. And we've had a lot of conversations over the last 2 years as to whether we could really drive a subscription business on our core switching platforms. And what we see is that, at least, early indications are that we can do that. So we talked about our Data Center business. The ACI portfolio, again, record quarter, growing 38%. And then if you look at what we launched in the campus, typically, what we see is   these are 3-year cycles to transition these platforms.",".

Question: What are the early indications?

Answer: That we can drive a subscription business on our core switching platforms."
Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: But this is also not a typical platform transition. This is not speeds and feeds only. We brought forward some incredible innovation in this platform. And if you think about not only the actual product itself but the solutions that we announced around automation, which really gets at the operating expenses that our customers are incurring to manage their infrastructure, you look at one of the key drivers of why customers moved to the cloud, it was because of the complexity and the cost of their private infrastructure. So the ability to go drive significant cost out for our customers while managing this stuff over the next few years, we think, is a huge difference from a normal transition.","

What is the key driver of why customers moved to the cloud?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: The other is the fact that we launched Encrypted Traffic Analytics, which is our ability to determine when there's malware inside encrypted traffic without decrypting it, and that's an innovation that only Cisco can actually deliver. And both of those pieces of technology are what are included in that advanced subscription, which is what tells us that the customers see tremendous value in that subscription. So normally, we see 3 years. It's very early. And we would like to believe that we can accelerate that based on the incremental innovation that's being delivered as part of the platform, Ittai, but we'll have to see how it goes over the next quarter or 2.

Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: First of all, we talked about Mexico last quarter, which is generally in the same state it was last quarter. We didn't see any significant change, and again, that's largely driven by service provider weakness due to regulatory transitions as well as geopolitical dynamics, NAFTA renegotiation, et cetera. Emerging countries were slightly better, but there's still just tremendous uncertainty and disparity between performance in those countries. And service provider is generally the same as it was last quarter. The 2 that you asked about, in particular, we did see some shifts. In U.S. federal, I would say, in Q3, we had a real lack of clarity around budgets. In early May, we began to see, obviously, the clarity with the continuing resolution.","

What was the impact of the continuing resolution on Cisco's federal business?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: And the way that the dollars get released in federal, we're in like the fourth phase based on how they prioritize releasing those budget funds. So we saw some improvement, not where we'd like for it to be, but we saw some improvement, particularly late in the quarter. And obviously, in federal, we're going to be facing the same issue again in 90 days, at the end of September, as we try to get another budget resolution passed. But you can see, on a global public sector perspective, you saw our orders last quarter were at minus 4%. This quarter, they were at plus 2%, and that was clearly   a big part of that was the improvement we saw in the U.S. federal business. On the U.K., if you go back to Q3, we talked about it being significantly down.",".

Question: And can you give us a sense of what the order mix was like in the U.S. federal business?

Answer: So our order mix was basically more services and support, as opposed to equipment."
Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: And one of the primary drivers was the headwind created by currency. In Q4, what I'll tell you is that headwind from currency remained. It did not ease up. However, our teams did a really amazing job, and we saw significant improvement in our enterprise and commercial business in the U.K. And if you look at the overall performance in EMEAR, you can see that the strengthening in the U.K. for us actually helped achieve the result at the EMEAR level. I'll say one final thing. In U.K., while enterprise and commercial were   we saw a good uptick, service provider remained about the same.

If I look at your revenue guide for next quarter, so we're still slightly down year-on-year, but sequentially, the kind of revenue change you're guiding for is actually probably better than the average seasonality for Q1 of the last few years. So am I right thinking that the environment   you see the environment, the business environment, slightly improving sequentially after this quarter   this weaker quarter you were anticipating?

Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: Kelly, you want to talk a little bit about the revenue guide and margins?                                         
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO and EVP    [14]
                                                   Yes, sure. On the revenue guide, as you know, Pierre, we call it like we see it. And as Chuck mentioned, the bookings being much better in Q4 than Q3 certainly helped a lot. And I'll just mention that we are starting off with a strong backlog with our backlog being up 3%. And we have good momentum as we go in the quarter. So we feel good about the revenue call for Q1. As I talk about margins, yes, our margins for Q4 were in the range, but we definitely saw our product margins go down 2 points year-over-year. And it really comes down quite simply to 3 points.",".

Question: What was the main reason for the decrease in product margins? 
Answer: The main reason for the decrease in product margins was due to a decrease in gross margin percentage."
Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: The one and the biggest impact, by far, has been the increase of memory pricing and DRAM, specifically, for the overall business. That accounts for more than half of the 2 point decline. The second point that's really impacting that is in overall productivity. Whenever you have large parts of the portfolio or my largest business unit down 9%, like Switching, which is also a very profitable business, it impacts your ability to get cost savings in that quarter. So that was the second biggest driver. And then we just had a third driver, but to a much lesser extent, was a slight uptick in pricing erosion.

                                                   On the Security side, you said at the Analyst Day you expect low to mid-teens growth. You did talk about strong orders today, but the revenue growth was much less. I think you cited some legacy products holding things back. Do you have confidence that the reported revenue is going to get back into the double digits consistently?

                                                   Yes, Steve. So first, all I'll say on the Security, this is   I have zero concerns about the business. This is a revenue timing issue. Our orders were   they were some of the strongest   we saw some of the strongest order growth in the quarter as we've seen in the last 2 years.",". Question: What legacy products are you referring to? Answer: So legacy products are products that we've exited, products that we've sold, and products that are no longer in production."

And I think, Kelly, I have an instinctive answer on the second part, but you probably have the mathematical answer.

What is the total value of Cisco's service provider business?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: I think the way I would characterize it is it's less about different portions of the network, and it's really about the disparity across large customers. As I said in the last couple of calls, we literally had some very big customers that were growing double digits and others that were on the opposite side of that. So it really is more of a customer variability issue than it is a single place in the network infrastructure that is causing a problem. And that's what we've seen for several quarters. And again, some of it is based on regulatory issues and geopolitical dynamics. Others are based on consolidation going on in a certain part of the industry.

Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO and EVP    [45]
                                                   Yes.

                                                   So let me ask you a question and 2 clarifications, the question being, what was the drag on growth from the shift to subscriptions this quarter? And can you talk about what your product segment growth would look like on a normalized basis, i.e., adjusting for the shift in subscriptions? I'm aware that wireless WAN in Collaboration have been the 2 places where   in Security, where it's been first implemented. But can you talk to us about what the growth will look like on a product line basis correcting for that? And the clarification, Kelly, you mentioned the tick-up in price erosion.",".

What was the drag on growth from the shift to subscriptions this quarter?
On a normalized basis, product segment growth would look like adjusting for the shift in subscriptions."
Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: Was it still below 3%? And can you tell us what the decline in campus switching was and what was the all-in growth rate of Data Center? So not just ACI but taking into account the 7,000 and whatever other products are in that.                                         
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO and EVP    [48]
                                                   Yes, sure. So on the shift, first, it's not much different than we told you. It's basically about 2%, between the 1.5% and 2%. And you hit the   obviously, Security impacts the most. Collaboration has always been that way, and that just continues to grow. But if you restated it Security will be impacted, wireless will be impacted. And now with Cisco ONE really ramping up and added hundreds of millions of dollars on the balance sheet, that would have an impact as well.",".

On the decline in campus switching, it was primarily due to the slowdown in the US economy and the impact of Security threats. On the all-in growth rate of Data Center, it was driven by the growth of cloud services and the increasing demand for data center capacity."
Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: And that is the piece that will accelerate even more as we get more traction on the Catalyst 9000 switches platform. So it's kind of across the board. In terms of Data Center overall   so if I look at Switching and Switching being down 9%, the bulk of it was campus switching, and that was over double digit. So that was the biggest drag. data center switching, all-in, was basically flattish to slightly up but basically flattish.

Simon Matthew Leopold,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [54]
                                                   I wanted to see if we could maybe double-click down on the Security business. In light of the headlines we've heard in the security space over the last couple months in terms of attacks, I think of the case of Nuance, it highlighted employing Cisco. And I recall your discussions in the past about the need for security to be an architectural solution and not a point solution. So it sounds like the market is moving towards the pitch you've made, and it's made sense for a long time.",".

1. What is the market trend towards security being an architectural solution?
2. What was the rationale behind Cisco's decision to partner with Nuance?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: I'm just trying to see if you can help us quantify the outlook for your Security business, if you see an inflection point of the business moving more towards a solution sale than point products versus what we've seen in the past.                                         
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO and Director    [55]
                                                   Thanks for the question, Simon. The short answer is yes. And what's happened is if you think about how our customers are building their IT infrastructure or how their IT assets are being deployed, they're in a massively distributed mode. And they're trying to navigate and manage technology assets, spanning from the public cloud to connected vehicles, connected mining operations, all the way back to their private data center over to SaaS applications.",". 1. What is the ""massively distributed mode""? 
2. What is the ""navigating and managing technology assets"" Cisco refers to? 
3. What is the ""public cloud"", ""connected vehicles"", ""connected mining operations"", and ""private data center""?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: So the architecture of sort of hair-pinning all that stuff back to a central point in the enterprise is not going to be sustainable. Therefore, we see our customers transitioning to a new   fundamentally new architecture that's enabled by the network. And that's why they're moving to the security architecture because, as I said, our teams have built this strategy where you have to deploy Security Everywhere, which is at the endpoint in the network in the cloud. And I think as it relates to some of the attacks, I don't remember the number exactly last quarter or the quarter before relative to our   the threat, new threat customers that we have, the AMP customers. But I believe the 7,600 this quarter was a pretty significant increase over what we saw during a quarter over the last 2 quarters.",".

Question: What is the new architecture enabled by the network?

Answer: The new architecture is enabled by the network and is based on the security architecture."
Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: And I think that's probably related to not only the architectural buy-in that our customers have but also the fact that, that solution was pretty resilient during the recent ransomware attacks.

                                                   I would like to delve into the service provider outlook a little bit, if we could. It sounds as though   we understand that things aren't perfect around the world for you.",".

What are your thoughts on the service provider outlook?

We are seeing some stabilization in the market, but we continue to see some challenges."
Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: My question is, how much of where we are in service provider do you consider to be cyclical? And how much of this is structural? I mean, do you think that we should see the service provider orders be in that 1% to 3% growth range that you've highlighted for the overall business?                                         
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO and Director    [58]
                                                   Let me see if I can break this down into 3 sort of qualitative areas that, I think, we are focused on that can actually improve the service provider performance over the next 3 to 7 quarters over the next 2 years. I think first is we have increased our presence, our relevance in the web scale cloud providers that we've talked about. That's first and foremost.",".

1. How has Cisco increased its presence in web scale cloud providers?

Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: Second is there are   there's innovation that we are working on that we talked a little bit about at the Financial Analyst Conference that will be coming out probably a few quarters from now that will give us some transition opportunities in some of our platforms. And then finally, I think the other is there's   I would characterize as a combination of sort of macro issues as well as technology transitions. I think you're going to see customers   and we're beginning to have discussions with customers who are thinking about 5G.","

What innovation will give Cisco Systems Inc transition opportunities in its platforms?

The innovation will give Cisco Systems Inc transition opportunities in its platforms as it will allow the company to move away from certain legacy platforms."
Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: And while we're not in the macro radio space, one of the key things that they are working on or thinking about is, as I add a significant number of new devices at higher speeds and lower latency out of the edge of the network, what is that going to mean for the performance I'm going to need in the core of the network? So I think as we see some of the geopolitical dynamics hopefully settle down, but I wouldn't count on that right now, but the overall   I think the 5G trend and that transition is the other one that could help us over the next couple years.

How should investors anticipate potential margin volatility over the next 1 to 2 years related to the transition to the highly attractive subscription model?

I think the other parts of gross margin are continuing to   we're executing and managing those well, like we always have, on the cost savings sides and managing price as well. So I think it's really   the big question mark and the big headwind is the memory.

Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: And thanks, everybody, for participating with us today. 
I think there are 4 key messages that I would probably leave you with. First is that this launch that we announced back about 8 weeks ago was the first of what I believe you should expect from us in just an ongoing cycle of innovation and very positively received by the press, analysts, customers, partners, employees. And I said, when I took this job, we're going to increase the pace of innovation, and this is the first wave of what you're going to see coming from us. And when you look at the innovation that was introduced, particularly around the automation, around the new platform and the innovation we drove in the security capabilities, that's what you're going to see from us going forward.",".

Question: What is the first wave of what you're going to see coming from Cisco Systems?

Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: 
Secondly, I think with the   our customers and the environments in which they're operating now, the network's never been more relevant. And I talked about how they're building out their infrastructure in very distributed ways. They're managing hundreds and thousands of devices today, and they have to be ready to manage 1 million or more by 2020. And I think that, that is why this automation and analytics capability and the security built into the network is so important. 
The third is that we continue to have our customers looking for us to help them really build out the secure intelligent platform that spans across this multicloud environment for their digital business. And I think that our Security results on the number of new customers embracing the technology, I think, is indicative of how they're buying into this new architecture.",".

Q: What is the main reason that customers are looking to Cisco for help with building out their secure intelligent platform?
A: The main reason that customers are looking to Cisco for help with building out their secure intelligent platform is because they see the network as being more relevant than ever in today's multicloud environment."
Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: 
And then fourth, I would say that the strategy we laid out, we're executing very well against. We're managing the business through this transition. When you look at the year that we just completed, having record EPS, record cash flow at the same time that we, this past quarter, increased the software and subscription deferred business, 50% to $5 billion. 
And so I'm very pleased with where our teams are, what our teams are doing, how we're executing and how we've increased the innovation and the response from our customers. So we look forward to talking to you all again next quarter, and thanks for joining us today.
