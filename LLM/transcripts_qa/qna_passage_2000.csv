                                                   Yes. So I think you summarized the revenue guidance well. I think we see the Computing and Graphics business accelerating on the strength of the new products. We do have a bit of a year-over-year headwind when we compare game consoles. When you look at our Q3 margin guidance, we are certainly up year-over-year 3 points, and so I think that's the strength of the product portfolio.",".

Question: What is the headwind for game consoles in Q3? 
Answer: The headwind for game consoles in Q3 is due to the fact that they are not as popular this year."

I think that's a mix of a couple things. That's a mix of gaming being seasonally stronger in the third quarter. That's a mix of inventories being very low in the channel, and there is a crypto   probably a cryptocurrency component as well relative to overall demand.

                                                   I think it's   if you look at the inventory, in fact, if you look at it from my standpoint and the strength of the business, there's revenue growth, we are obviously buying wafers in support of the stronger revenue. Some of the ramp in new products does have an impact on the inventory and obviously, we want to support all of new product ramps. It's down marginally in the quarter, but I expect that in Q3 it will go down. And then we have previously guided down year-over-year, so I expect, when we end the year, it will be down in 2017 compared to 2016 while fully supporting the needs of the business.

What are you doing or can do to recreate those conditions?"
Edited version Q2 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: But I think the other conditions that are different and perhaps even more favorable than in the past is the fact that the cloud data center guys are making up such a large piece of the market, and they tend to move faster in their qualification cycles given the fact that they have sort of more control of their own software environment. So I think our differentiation is strong.

I've actually been very happy with how they've jumped on the support of it. We have been continuing to improve the ecosystem. So if you look at the motherboards and if you look at the memory capability, they've significantly improved just in the last 3 or 4 months.

So definitely, we see top-tier cloud guys very engaged with EPYC and talking about a number of different instances. Microsoft Azure was at our launch event, and Baidu was at our launch event. And we're working with a number of other cloud vendors as well. But we also have a very strong OEM support base as well. So with HPE and Dell putting out a number of platforms with EPYC, I think that will ramp enterprise customers in 2018 as well.

                                                   Lisa, can you give us a sense of how EPYC is doing in virtualized environments because there might be some issues regarding compatibility with the other x86 suppliers and how you would go through that process over the next several quarters?                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [46]
                                                   Yes. Again, Hans, I think we have been working closely with a number of different customers, including in virtualized environments. We see no particular issues other than just getting their platforms up and running. And so I think we continue to believe EPYC will do very well in those environments.                                         
Hans Carl Mosesmann,  Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [47]

What is the CEO's view on the competitive landscape in the x86 market?

The CEO believes that EPYC will do well in the x86 market."
Edited version Q2 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: And then as a follow-up, can you give us a sense, now that EPYC is out, what the feedback is from your customers, cloud or OEM, regarding your packaging approach in terms of using a multi-chip module type approach versus a monolithic silicon approach?                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [48]
                                                   Yes. Hans, actually, the feedback has been actually quite good, and I think the   what we're able to do   obviously, it's a decision to make, right? We could have built one big monolithic chip or   we decided very strategically to build a modular approach because it just gives us so much flexibility when we talk about the combination of CPU cores and I/O. So, so far, so good.",".

Question: What are the benefits of using a modular approach for packaging?
Answer: The benefits of using a modular approach for packaging are that it gives us a lot of flexibility when it comes to the combination of CPU cores and I/O."
Edited version Q2 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: I think there is some work to do to make sure that the latencies are appropriately taken care of, and the customers are working with us on that. I think the flexibility is really, really appreciated, particularly when you look at what we can do with single-socket servers as well. So we feel very good about where EPYC is positioned. I think the customer feedback continues to be very strong, and our goal is to get as many platforms out as possible with EPYC this year.

John William Pitzer,  CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [50]
                                                   Lisa, notwithstanding the possibility that you guys beat your revised guidance you just gave today, if you just go by the revised guidance, it's kind of implying calendar fourth quarter revenue down about 10% sequentially, which is about in line with seasonal. Just kind of curious, just given where you are in the product cycle for Ryzen and EPYC, why a seasonal quarter wouldn't be something that you could beat? And I guess, equally important, are you planning to stay profitable in the calendar fourth quarter if it is down seasonal just given the trajectory of OpEx?                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [51]
                                                   Yes. So yes, John, let me answer that.",.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Edited version Q2 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: When you look at our typical seasonality, as you said, we tend to be down in Q4. Semi-custom is still a large, large piece of our business and semi-custom will peak in Q3. And it will come down in Q4. I also think that we want to be cognizant of the fact that some of the graphics demand that we see might be temporal, so we're not counting on that staying through the full year. We'll see what happens. Frankly, I think we'll see what happens with the whole mining stuff. But I think when you look overall, I think that it shows that the business is strengthening. And so we like the growth very much. Ryzen will continue to grow through the second half. EPYC will continue to grow through the second half.",".

Question: What do you think is driving the strength in the business?

Answer: We think it's a combination of things. We think that Ryzen is doing well, EPYC is doing well, and we're seeing good demand for our products."
Edited version Q2 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Vega and our GPU business will continue to grow through the second half, and the only headwind that we have is through the game console business just as part of normal seasonality. And then relative to the profit statement...                                         
Devinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CFO, SVP and Treasurer    [52]
                                                   I think it's hard to predict that right now, John. I think if you look at our guidance, as we said, revenue, mid- to high teens, which, from our standpoint, is 16, 17-ish increase. And we'll get to Q4 when we get there.                                         
John William Pitzer,  CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [53]
                                                   That's helpful.",".

What is the guidance for revenue in the second half of 2017?"
Edited version Q2 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: And then, Lisa, for my follow-up, R&D ticking up, which is absolutely the right thing to do for the longer-term health of the business, but I'm just kind of curious if you could help me understand your sort of R&D priorities. To what extent is this uptick in R&D really to help bolster your position in existing markets versus sort of R&D dollars to go after new markets, whether that be acceleration, machine learning or autonomous driving? How should I think about that?                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [54]
                                                   Yes. So I think there are a couple points, John, that I want to make sure that we're clear about. Although OpEx is going up and R&D is going up, we're doing it in a very thoughtful fashion.",".

1. What is the rationale behind the uptick in R&D spending?
2. How will this increase in R&D help AMD compete in existing markets versus pursue new markets?"
Edited version Q2 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: And so staying within the confines of the business model is really important. And as Devinder said earlier, our model that we laid out at Financial Analyst Day for 2017 has us, let's call it, at approximately 31% ER, and we're going to stay within that model for sure. Now relative to priorities in R&D, it is very much focused on sort of the new growth areas for us, very much focused on data center and very much focused on GPU computes around machine learning and sort of the entire compute space on the GPU side. It is fairly incremental in terms of adding things like customer support, field application engineering, software support given that we're familiarizing people with our architecture. So I think it's good.","

Question: What are the new growth areas for AMD in terms of R&D?

Answer: Relative to priorities in R&D, it is very much focused on sort of the new growth areas for us, very much focused on data center and very much focused on GPU computes around machine learning and sort of the entire compute space on the GPU side."
Edited version Q2 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: We're happy that the business affords us the ability to increase R&D in this time frame, and we're using it to accelerate our growth in these high-margin markets.

                                                   Our next question is coming from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho.                                         
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh,  Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research & Senior Semiconductor Analyst    [56]
                                                   Perhaps, Lisa, when you look at the EPYC, I know you said 20 customers already and then 20 more in the second half. Do you think that gets to 5% of your revenues, just the EPYC side of your revenues as you look at the third quarter? And should we assume pretty incrementally [about  ] not the 50% margins on your EPYC product, especially as it goes in the data center side?                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",".

Q: What is your outlook for EPYC revenue in the third quarter?
A: We expect EPYC revenue to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million in the third quarter."
Edited version Q2 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [57]
                                                   So Vijay, without getting too granular about percentage of EPYC revenue, I think what we've said is our target for EPYC, we sort of have   the midterm target is to get back to double-digit market share, so over 10%. We think that we have a product and a customer set in an environment that does support that. It will take longer than this year to get there. So I think this is a multiple-quarter ramp for us. But in terms of how we've laid out the business model, I mean, that's all contemplated sort of in our overall growth model for 2017.",".

Question: What is your target for EPYC market share in 2017?
Answer: Our target is to get back to double-digit market share."
Edited version Q2 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: As it relates to margins, again, without being very specific, I would say the EPYC margins are highly accretive even at our current sort of pricing, which offers, I would say, significant value to the customer. I think it also gives us significant credit for the capability of the product. And so the margins are accretive to our business model.                                         
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh,  Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research & Senior Semiconductor Analyst    [58]
                                                   Got it. Very helpful. Just on the Radeon Instinct side, too, can you give us some similar commentary on how you see in terms of customer adoption and what the response has been similar to EPYC?                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [59]
                                                   Yes, yes.",".

Q: What is your outlook for Radeon Instinct?
A: We see strong customer adoption of Radeon Instinct across a wide range of markets. We are seeing great response from our customers, with demand outpacing supply in most cases."
Edited version Q2 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: The Radeon Instinct similarly has a lot of interest from the marketplace, a number of different applications. We started shipping actually in July to some strategic data center customers. We see that interest continue to ramp. There, I think it is   this is definitely a lumpy business. And so it goes, as a cloud guy puts on a new instance, you would see a larger buy, and that's the way it would work. But again, very good market. I think we're in the very early part of the growth trajectory for AMD in these markets, and we'll continue to invest and work closely with customers to ramp those platforms.

                                                   Lisa, I just want to follow up on the   your comments on the cryptocurrency market. Just curious what's your visibility into whether someone   obviously, they buy a dedicated card. It would be easy to track. Just your visibility on the back end as to where the strength in the overall GPU market is coming from. You mentioned it as a third factor, I think, in September, but then mentioned it may impact December and if you can just talk about in that full year guide, are you factoring in any contribution in December?                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [62]
                                                   We're being conservative in our estimates for what will happen as we get into the fourth quarter.",".

What is your visibility into the cryptocurrency market?"
Edited version Q2 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: I think the visibility is not   it's anyone's guess at this moment. However, I think what we are doing very clearly is prioritizing sort of the core customer set so that we're segmenting the market. You can never segment it perfectly, but I think we are segmenting it well. And we continue to be very closely in tune with our partners and how this develops. And my expectation is that there will be a leveling off of the demand at some point. And as we fill the channel, that will become clear in what the level-off point is. But right now as we said, the channel inventories are very low, and so it's hard to call the absolute demand. And we're ensuring that we're not overcalling the demand.","

What is your expectation for the demand level in the near future? My expectation is that it will level off at some point."

                                                   And then just a question for Devinder. The OpEx step-up in September, it's hard to tell from the full year guide, 31% can round a bunch of different ways. Just curious if you expect any follow-through in that increase in R&D into the December quarter? And then if you could just mention also timing of the JV payment. Obviously, you're not getting any in the back half of this year. Maybe you could talk about the milestones into next year and when those should come back as offsets.

And we'll update that as we get closer. As far as the OpEx is concerned, I think we've said a lot, and we stand by what we said. We'll manage within our guidance of expense-to-revenue ratio of approximately 31% for the year.

First quarter revenue increased 18% from a year ago to $984 million based on growth across both of our business segments. Gross margin also improved, driven largely by the success of our recently launched Ryzen CPUs. I am pleased with our first quarter product execution and improved year-over-year financial results, which demonstrate the revenue growth and gross margin expansion potential with our strong set of new products.",". Q1 2017 revenue growth was primarily due to Ryzen CPU sales?
Yes, the growth in Q1 2017 was primarily due to Ryzen CPU sales."
Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: 
Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment. We delivered our fourth straight quarter of double-digit percentage year-on-year revenue growth. Strong demand for Ryzen CPUs and improved GPU sales resulted in CG revenue increasing 29% from the year-ago period. CG revenue declined 1% sequentially, which was better-than-normal seasonality as significant growth in desktop processor sales, driven by the first month of Ryzen CPU sales, largely offset seasonal declines in GPU and notebook APU sales. 
Solid demand for our family of premium Ryzen 7 processors, including our flagship Ryzen 7 1800X offering, which is the industry's highest performance 8-core CPU, drove our highest desktop processor revenue in more than 2 years. Ryzen CPUs have been consistently ranked among the top-selling processors at global e-tailers and retailers. And press reviews and end-user sentiment have highlighted the strong performance and value proposition.",".

What was the main driver of CG revenue growth in the fourth quarter?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: 
In early April, we launched our enthusiast-class Ryzen 5 processors and received overwhelmingly positive reviews that demonstrate our multi-threaded leadership and unmatched value proposition. 
The Ryzen CPU partner ecosystem also continues to strengthen. We have seated more than 300 software developers to support their work optimizing for Ryzen CPUs and have already seen double-digit performance gains across a number of top-tier gaming titles. Last week, the first Ryzen-based OEM gaming desktops were announced, and we continue the rapid rollout of Ryzen-powered systems with additional launches planned for major OEMs later this quarter. 
In Graphics, GPU sales increased by a strong double-digit percentage from a year ago based on growth across all of our product lines. The ramp of Polaris-based notebook design wins drove increased mobile GPU sales while our desktop growth was led by improved channel sales.",".

Question: What was the increase in GPU sales from a year ago?
Answer: The ramp of Polaris-based notebook design wins drove increased mobile GPU sales while our desktop growth was led by improved channel sales."
Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: 
In early Q2, we launched 4 new Radeon RX 500 GPUs, featuring our Polaris architecture that deliver improved performance. These new mainstream GPUs provide a compelling solution for the millions of gamers looking to upgrade their PCs to support advanced display technologies and deliver optimal gaming experiences. 
We also saw higher professional graphics revenue from a year ago, driven by expanding channel sales and growing data center wins, as we continue to increase our GPU-compute footprint with leading cloud service providers. 
We remain on track to launch the first products from our next-generation Radeon Vega family later this quarter. Vega is a forward-looking architecture that combines a revolutionary memory subsystem, next-generation compute engine, advanced pixel engine and new geometry pipeline to dramatically improve performance and energy efficiency for the next generation of GPU workloads.",".

Question: What is the name of the new mainstream GPU that was launched in early Q2?
Answer: The new mainstream GPU is called the Radeon RX 500."
Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Customer excitement is building as we focus on bringing significant competition to the high-end GPU space across the PC gaming, professional design and GPU compute markets. 
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, revenue increased 5% from a year ago, driven by the latest game console offerings from Sony and Microsoft and our third straight quarter delivering year-on-year embedded revenue growth. We see solid demand for our latest FinFET-based semi-custom offerings in 2017, including the planned holiday launch of Microsoft's 4K-focused Project Scorpio console featuring a new AMD SoC. 
On the data center front, in March, we demonstrated that our upcoming Naples server CPU would offer more cores, I/O and memory bandwidth when compared to the highest-end dual socket x86 server CPUs currently available, resulting in better performance across multiple workloads.",".

What is the name of the game console from Sony and Microsoft that is driving the increase in revenue for AMD's Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment?

The name of the game console is Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro and Microsoft's Xbox One S."
Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: 
Naples platform development work continued to accelerate in the quarter.

                                                   Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a good start to 2017 as we expanded gross margin, increased revenue 18% year-over-year to $984 million and reduced losses year-over-year. 
Computing and Graphics segment revenue increased 29% year-over-year, driven by the launch of our high-performance Ryzen desktop processors and our strengthened GPU product portfolio. Our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue increased 5% from a year ago. 
Let me provide some specifics for the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin was 34%, up 2 percentage points year-over-year, driven by a higher overall mix of revenue from our Computing and Graphics segment and a richer product mix within that segment, due to Ryzen desktop processor sales. 
Operating expenses were $364 million compared to $332 million a year ago.",".

Question: What was the overall mix of revenue from the Computing and Graphics segment for the first quarter of 2017?
Answer: The overall mix of revenue from the Computing and Graphics segment for the first quarter of 2017 was higher due to Ryzen desktop processor sales."
Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: The increase is due primarily to R&D investments in Graphics and our server business. Net licensing gain from our server JV with THATIC was $27 million compared to $7 million a year ago. Operating loss was $6 million in the first quarter of 2017, a significant improvement from a $55 million loss a year ago. 
First quarter net interest expense, taxes and other was $32 million, down from $41 million year-over-year, primarily due to a lower overall interest rate and a lower debt balance. Net loss was $38 million, or loss per share of $0.04 calculated using 939 million shares of common stock as compared to a net loss of $96 million or $0.12 a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $28 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of negative $22 million from a year ago.",".

What was the primary driver of the increase in net licensing gain from the server JV with THATIC?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: 
Now turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics revenue was $593 million, up 29% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher Ryzen desktop, CPU and graphics processor sales. The better-than-seasonal quarter-over-quarter decrease was due to lower mobile and graphics processor sales, largely offset by Ryzen desktop processor sales. 
Computing and Graphics business segment operating loss was $15 million, a significant improvement from a loss of $70 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher revenue. 
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $391 million, up 5% year-over-year, primarily due to higher semi-custom SoC sales. Operating income was $9 million, down from $16 million a year ago, due primarily to higher server-related R&D investments, largely offset by an increase in the THATIC JV licensing gain. 
Turning to the balance sheet.",".

What is the year-over-year increase in Ryzen desktop, CPU and graphics processor sales?

The sequential decrease was driven primarily by the timing of sales and cash collections, debt interest payments and increased inventory. 
Inventory ended at $839 million compared to $751 million at year-end in support of the ramp of new products and increased semi-custom SoC sales in the second quarter. 
Long-term debt on the balance sheet was $1.41 billion, down from $1.44 billion at year-end, primarily due to debt reduction activities. The principal debt amount was $1.73 billion, down $34 million from the prior quarter as a result of debt reduction actions. 
Turning to our outlook for the second quarter of 2017, which is a 13-week quarter.",".

What is the sequential decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities?

                                                   Lisa, I wonder if you could spend a little bit more time talking about the Ryzen desktop launch, how you would characterize that it's gone so far? Maybe any kind of quantification you can give on revenue for the 1 month you had in the first quarter and then for the second quarter guidance? And then anything that might have limited sales in the quarter. We heard things about, shortages of motherboards from the SKU suppliers, et cetera. So any kind of additional commentary around the Ryzen launch would be really helpful.                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [3]
                                                   Yes, sure, absolutely, Matt.

Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: It was a big launch for us. We did Ryzen 7 first in early March and then Ryzen 5 here in the middle of April. All of the feedback that we've gotten so far from both our customers and from end users has been very strong. I think the value proposition is very strong at both the Ryzen 7 8-core devices as well as the Ryzen 5 4- and 6-core devices. Relative to how it performed in the quarter, actually it performed as we expected. So with the global launch, we were reaching many distributors and many channel partners, and I think that's going well. We did see some early shortages in terms of motherboards, and that was our motherboard partners ramping their supply in line with our CPU supply.","

Q: What are your thoughts on the Ryzen 7 8-core and Ryzen 5 4-core processors?

A: We're really happy with how they've performed. Relative to how they performed in the quarter, actually they performed as we expected."
Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: But that was really dissipated after the first couple of weeks. So nothing out of the ordinary there. So we feel really good about where it is. I think the important thing is as we go into the second quarter, we not only have the channel sales, but we also have the major OEMs that will be launching their systems in the second quarter. So I think that's the next piece of the Ryzen launch for us. But overall, I would say it went quite well.                                         
Matthew D. Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - Principal and Senior Analyst    [4]
                                                   And just as my follow-up question, wanted to ask a little bit about gross margin.",".

What was the gross margin for the first quarter?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Lisa, you talked in your prepared remarks about as the new product roll out across the different parts of the company through the year that margins should expand. Yet your   with a full quarter of Ryzen, you're guiding gross margin down slightly sequentially. I know the new gaming console business starts to ramp for the upcoming season in that quarter as well. So any kind of puts and takes around that gross margin? Because for some reaction I got from investors tonight that sequentially down gross margin surprised a couple of folks. So any clarification there would be helpful.                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [5]
                                                   Yes. Absolutely, Matt. So if you look at our gross margin progression, given the mix of our business, clearly we made actually very nice progress year-over-year.",". 

Q: So gross margin is down sequentially, but you're guiding it to still be in the high 40s?
A: Yes. We're guiding gross margin to be in the high 40s."
Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So if you look at Q1 2017 compared to Q1 2016, we expanded margin by 2 points and that was really on the strength of Ryzen. When you look sequentially, because of the mix of our business, game consoles were at the lowest point in the first quarter, and there will be a ramp of game consoles going into the second quarter. So the relative mix of the business sees more game consoles in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. So that's the reason for the sequential guidance. But again, if you look year-on-year, Q2 '17 to Q2 '16, you see again a nice margin expansion as a result of the strength of the products.

And you had an explanation for that, but if I recall right, you thought it'd be flat. So I'm just wondering what changed there?

The ramp of new products and especially the ramp of the semi-custom product revenue that Lisa just talked about was the main reason for the high inventory. We also had the opportunity in the quarter to put [those wafers] in Q1 ahead of Q2 sales and took advantage of the opportunity leading to the inventory at the $839 million.

                                                   For the first one, I'm a little surprised on the [CSG] business, you said   I mean, sales were roughly flat, sequentially, give or take. You said Ryzen sales made up for seasonally lower GPUs in notebooks we have   should have materially lower margins. I'm just amazed   I'm just very surprised that the loss in the business barely got any better.",".

I think certainly the rise in gross margins are substantially better than the legacy portfolio. So I think that is true. I think when you look at the sequential, there was 1% sequential decline, and there was a $7 million or $8 million sequential improvement in operating loss.",".

Question: Why did the CPU margins not improve just given the ramp? 
Answer: I think it's a combination of things. I think there was a sequential improvement in gross margin, but I think there was also a sequential improvement in operating loss. So I think it's a combination of both gross margin and operating loss improvements that led to the better margins."
Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: There was also some additional R&D in that segment as we're ramping up both product expenses as well as some sales and marketing and go-to-market expenses in the quarter.

                                                   So you have effectively taken your OpEx up then, because it doesn't look like your OpEx is coming down by the same amount. So you're spending more?

                                                   Lisa, can you give us a sense of the introduction of Naples into the second half and next year? Is that going to reflect or be similar to what you're doing with the Ryzen 7 and then 5 and then 3? And I have a follow-up.                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [39]
                                                   Sure. So look, we're really pleased with where we are with the Naples program right now. Overall, from a performance standpoint of the product and the customer engagements, it's going as we would expect. We will launch here in the second quarter. So we'll start some low-volume of revenue shipments here in the second quarter that will ramp gradually into the second half of the year.",".

Q: What's the customer mix for Naples?
A: The customer mix for Naples is going to be Ryzen 7, Ryzen 5 and then some lower-volume products that are based on the Zen+ architecture."
Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: And so overall, I think that is how the server outlook will be. I think I have said before, and I did still say, that the server market has a longer design win to revenue conversion cycle. And so we would expect it to take a couple quarters for us to ramp the Naples product over time. And you should see a number of customers announcing with AMD platforms over the next couple quarters.                                         
Hans Carl Mosesmann,  Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [40]
                                                   Great. And then as a follow-up on the server side, what's the strategy in terms of positioning of the product? I mean, traditionally, in most cases, it's been more of, like, a me-too product at the low end of the market. What's the strategy here? If you can share that with us.",".

The strategy for positioning the product is to generate a longer design win to revenue conversion cycle. This will take a couple quarters for us to ramp the Naples product over time. You should see a number of customers announcing with AMD platforms over the next couple quarters."

                                                   Yes. So we believe we're highly differentiated with Naples in the sense that we have more cores, we have more memory bandwidth, we have more I/O than our competition. So for certain workloads, I think Naples is going to do very, very well, certainly, in the cloud as well as in certain HPC workloads and big data workloads that can use all of that memory and I/O bandwidth. We will be talking more about the positioning of Naples and the key workloads as we go through the next couple of months prior to launch. But certainly, we feel that it's, again, like Ryzen, on the strength of the Zen core, we have a very, very strong foundational product.",".

What are the key workloads that will benefit from the increased memory and I/O bandwidth of Naples?"

Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So, look, we started selling Ryzen on March 2, and a good piece of it was basically for us positioning into the distributors. We take revenue on a sellout model, and so you should think about   although we shipped a number of Ryzens, we didn't necessarily revenue them all in the quarter, just given that we're on a sellout model for our revenue recognition. In terms of where we are in the transition, Ryzen, non-Ryzen, we still have a long ways to go. I mean, the way you should think about it is Ryzen 7 was at the very high end. We're going to   Ryzen 5 has started, we have Ryzen 3 that will come next and then we have the entire mobile portfolio as well.",".

And then just I wanted to clarify on the expense, it should hit gross margin, but can you just talk about 7-nanometer as a whole and timing as those would come through? Is it a back   is the CapEx back-end loaded when you're doing the $140 million? And then just talk about the impact to the gross margin with the higher 7-nanometer spend now hitting gross margin.

                                                   Yes. Maybe let me start on the OpEx and then have Devinder comment on the second piece of the question.",".

AMD is spending $1.4 billion on OpEx in 2017."
Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So on the OpEx, we are making targeted investments in several different areas. The key areas are in GPUs and server. And it's both on the R&D side as well as on some go to market. So from our standpoint, these are very strong products. We want to make sure that we have enough customer resources to help our customers ramp into production. So I think they're targeted investments, but as we've been in the past, we'll be very prudent with where the OpEx goes. And then relative to the...

                                                   They're all contemplated. I think we've had a lot of discussion on the gross margin improvement year-over-year and sequentially. And Lisa has referenced about improving gross margins as we go through the year and the move of the other expenses from the OpEx side related to the mask costs capitalization to the COGS side of it, which impacts gross margin, is all contemplated in that gross margin improvement.

                                                   I wonder if you could talk about what the CPU mix looks like over the course of the year. And you've talked a lot about the Ryzen ramp, but what's happening to the older products? Do you see a long tail on that? Or is there a coexistence between the 2 product portfolios? Or are you sort of rotating everything to Ryzen on a faster basis?                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [66]
                                                   Yes. So, Joe, the way to think about that is for the Ryzen 7 and a good portion of the Ryzen 5, we really didn't have a competing product in that segment, so it's really additive. I mean, we've actually added [SAM] to our CPU market coverage.",".

Question: What is the CPU mix looking like over the course of the year?
Answer: The CPU mix looks like it's going to be mostly Ryzen products."
Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: The legacy products will continue in the market. They would certainly continue through this year, and that's all contemplated in the model. So we feel that they're very complementary products. And different geographies move at different rates. We have still a significant installed base of motherboards out there from our previous generation, so we'll keep supporting both products.

                                                   Okay, great. That's helpful. And then as you've talked about getting better Ryzen penetration over the course of the year, how do you think about Intel's new products in the back half? And you know, they've talked about sort of a 15% performance per clock improvement on their new 14-nanometer product.",".

What is AMD's view of Intel's new products in the back half?

We believe that Intel's new products in the back half will be complementary to our legacy products and that different geographies will move at different rates."
Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Is that contemplated in your guidance? And how are you thinking about the Ryzen products stacking up against that?

                                                   Yes. So we're very pleased with where the Ryzen product is positioned now. We think, from a value proposition standpoint, performance, performance per dollar, it's very strong. We obviously have   other products are   we're going to be launching throughout the year to ensure that we have strong product positioning throughout the year. And I think the more important thing, Joe, and we'll talk more about this at our Financial Analyst Day, is we have a long-term road map, whether you're talking about PCs or GPUs or servers, to ensure that we continue to refresh our product plans and our product road maps over time.","

Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland,  Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [70]
                                                   I wanted to ask about the staggered launch to the major PC OEMs. Was that like just a modest supply constraint on the rollout? Or if not, then why not just launch to the enthusiast and the major PC OEM market together? And do you plan to do the same on Ryzen 5 and 3?                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - CEO, President and Non-Independent Director    [71]
                                                   Yes, Chris. So there was no particular supply constraint.",".

What was the reason for the staggered launch to the major PC OEMs?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: I think it's more of the ebb and flow of the market. When you think about the channel market or the DIY market, you can basically introduce your product any time during the year. The OEMs have a very set cycle. They typically launch new products in Q2 for the back-to-school season, and so that was just the timing of when the OEM platforms were ready. And then again, when you're launching so many different SKUs, I think launching Ryzen 7 first, then Ryzen 5, then Ryzen 3 was absolutely our plan to make sure that we hit all of the logistics and stuff on plan. But overall, like I said, nothing different than what we expected. I think we're pleased with where   the overall launches, and we'll be rolling out many more products over the coming quarters.","

Devinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [4]
                                                   Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with our performance for the third quarter of 2017. We increased revenue 26% year-over-year, expanded gross margin and achieved both operating and net income, with net income of $110 million and diluted earnings of $0.10 per share. We are executing well with our strongest portfolio of products in many years, including our Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon Vega offerings.",". Q: What was the main driver of revenue growth in the third quarter? A: The main driver of revenue growth in the third quarter was our Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon Vega offerings."
Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Let me provide some specifics for the third quarter.
Revenue of $1.64 billion grew 26% year-over-year and 34% sequentially. This is our highest quarterly revenue since the fourth quarter of 2011. Year-over-year growth was primarily due to our Computing and Graphics segment, while sequential growth was driven by the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue seasonality as well as higher Computing and Graphics segment revenue. We also took another step in our IP monetization efforts by closing a patent licensing agreement that had a positive impact on both our segments.
Gross margin was 35%, up 4 percentage points year-over-year, primarily driven by the benefit of IP-related revenue and a richer mix from the Computing and Graphics segment, which were partially offset by cost associated with our GLOBALFOUNDRIES Wafer Supply Agreement for wafers purchased at another foundry.",".

Question: What was the main driver of revenue growth in the third quarter?
Answer: The main driver of revenue growth in the third quarter was our Computing and Graphics segment, which grew 34% year-over-year and 26% sequentially."
Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: We continue to make good progress on the ramp of our new high-performance products, which had a positive impact on our gross margins.
Operating expenses were $419 million compared to $353 million a year ago. The increase was primarily due to higher R&D-related investments and expenses related to annual employee incentive programs driven by our better financial performance. Operating income was $155 million in the third quarter of 2017, a solid improvement from $70 million a year ago. Third quarter net interest expense, taxes and other was $45 million, up slightly from $43 million a year ago. Lower interest expense from a year ago was largely offset by withholding taxes for licensing revenue.
Net income was $110 million or diluted earnings of $0.10 per share as compared to $27 million or $0.03 per share a year ago.",".

What was the main reason for the increase in operating expenses?"
Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: The diluted earnings per share calculations for the third quarter of 2017 was based on 1.143 billion shares, which includes 100.6 million shares related to our 2026 convertible notes. Adjusted EBITDA was $191 million, compared to $103 million a year ago.
Now turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $819 million, up 74% year-over-year, primarily due to strong sales of our Radeon graphics and Ryzen desktop processors. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $70 million compared to a loss of $66 million a year ago. The solid improvement was primarily due to higher revenue.
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $824 million, approximately flat year-over-year due to lower semi-custom SoC sales partially offset by IP-related revenue. Additionally, server revenue increased from a year ago driven by the increased sales of EPYC products.",".

Question: What was the main reason for the 74% year-over-year increase in Computing and Graphics segment revenue?
Answer: The main reason for the 74% year-over-year increase in Computing and Graphics segment revenue was strong sales of our Radeon graphics and Ryzen desktop processors."
Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: As you heard earlier from Lisa, customer interest and deployment plans are strong. Operating income was $84 million, down $52 million from $136 million a year ago, primarily due to higher costs.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $879 million at the end of the quarter, up from $844 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher revenue. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $794 million, down 5% from $833 million in the prior quarter.
Long-term debt on the balance sheet was $1.36 billion. Total principal debt, including our secured revolving line of credit, was $1.74 billion. In the third quarter, we used $28 million from our lower interest secured revolving line of credit to pay down long-term debt, which has a higher interest rate.",".

Question: What was the primary reason for the decrease in operating income?
Answer: The primary reason for the decrease in operating income was higher costs, primarily due to increased research and development expenses."
Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Free cash flow was $32 million compared to $20 million in the year-ago period.
Before turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2017, which is a 13-week quarter, let me remind you for comparative purposes that the fourth quarter of 2016 was a 14-week quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2017, we expect revenue to decrease approximately 15% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. At the midpoint, this equates to revenue growth of approximately 26% year-over-year; non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 35%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $410 million; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $30 million; and inventory to be down sequentially. We now expect 2017 annual revenue to increase by greater than 20% over 2016 compared to the prior guidance of mid- to high-teens percentage growth.",".

Question: What is the midpoint of the sequential revenue growth estimate for the fourth quarter of 2017?

Vivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [2]
                                                   For the first one, I was wondering if you could help quantify the benefit of your IP license in the 2 different segments. And is this a one-off? Or do you see ongoing benefits in Q4 and beyond?                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]
                                                   Sure, Vivek. Hey, thanks for the question. We did close a IP-related transaction. It was a patent licensing transaction. The revenue and benefit was spread over both segments. When we look at it going forward, we have a pipeline of IP deals, and we're constantly looking at them. And from our standpoint, we're working several deals in progress.",".

What is the revenue and benefit of your IP license in the 2 different segments?"
Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So we believe that IP-related revenue will be a factor as we go forward, but our primary focus is on the product-related revenue and the product-related growth.                                         
Devinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [4]
                                                   So Vivek, just to remind you, I mean, in line, you've heard us talk about our IP monetization efforts, and this is very much in line with that. And as Lisa said, the benefit is spread over both segments.                                         
Vivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [5]
                                                   Got it. And then for my follow-up, Lisa, when I look at your Q4 outlook, it's sort of in line with seasonality, perhaps somewhat better.",".

What is the primary focus for Advanced Micro Devices in terms of revenue and growth?"
Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Can you give us some more color around the adoption of your   the new Ryzen Mobile portfolio, but more importantly, your EPYC products? When will we start to see a more tangible contribution from your EPYC product sales?

                                                   Yes, absolutely, Vivek. So look, we are very pleased with how the revenue ramp is going in general on our new products. When you look at the Q4 guidance, year-over-year, we'll be up 26%, so we're really accelerating the business as we go into the second half of the year. As you know, our business is typically seasonal. And so Q3 is the peak, and then we're down seasonally from Q3 to Q4 due to some of the semi-custom revenue.",".

Question: When will we start to see a more tangible contribution from your EPYC product sales?
Answer: We expect to see a more tangible contribution from EPYC product sales in the second half of the year."
Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: But what we see going into the fourth quarter is we see a strong ramp of new products. We see Ryzen continuing to ramp. We will ship volume of Ryzen Mobile in Q4 and then more in the first half of the year. We will see a ramp of EPYC, and we will also see an OEM ramp of Vega. In terms of the headwinds, we have the semi-custom seasonality, and we're also predicting that there will be some leveling off of some of the cryptocurrency demand. As we look at it, it continues to be a factor, but we've seen restocking in the channels and stuff like that. So we're being a little bit conservative on the cryptocurrency side of the equation.

                                                   Yes, sure, David. So look, the semi-custom business continues to be a business that's performing well for us. So we are   as we go into 2018, we are expanding the customer set beyond our traditional Sony and Microsoft game consoles. Actually, this past quarter, we announced that Atari will be adopting a customized processor for their next generation.",".

                                                   First one on the gross margin outlook for Q4, it looks like it's flattish versus Q3, and I guess I might have expected the   a sequential increase given that you will likely have a better mix. So I'm hoping you can reconcile that.",".

When we look at gross margin in Q3, we were pleased with the gross margin progress, and that came from both the richer mix of our Computing and Graphics revenue year-over-year as well as some benefit from the IP-related transaction. As we go into Q4, we have new products continuing to ramp, so you'll see Ryzen, Vega and EPYC ramp.",".

Question: What impact did the licensing have on gross margin in Q3? 
Answer: The licensing had no impact on gross margin in Q3."
Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: And the primary driver for the Q4 gross margin is the product revenue, and we do have sort of the headwind of not having the benefit of the IP revenue in Q3. So those are the puts and takes. But the main point is the new product revenue is ramping and the gross margins are accretive, and that's contributing to our Q4 gross margin outlook.                                         
Devinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [13]
                                                   Yes. Mark, if you can   if I can just add, if you look at the margin trend compared to 2016, 2016, we had 31% gross margin and we expect to be at 34% this year, and that's primarily based on the strength of the new products that Lisa referenced.",".

Question: What is the primary driver for the Q4 gross margin?

Q: What is the percentage of customers who are deploying EPYC in live data center applications?
A: We're pleased with how things are going with the EPYC ramp overall."
Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So we have been shipping to both cloud as well as non-cloud customers in Q3, mostly early platform type testing. In Q4, we will   we expect to see some level of deployment, again, both in cloud and non-cloud applications. With the new platforms coming in from HP Enterprise and Dell, what we're seeing is actually a ramp of new seeding opportunities, particularly in medium and large enterprise customers. So overall, the EPYC ramp is going well, and we expect more deployments as we go into Q4 and into next year.

                                                   I think the way I look at that is, if you look at Q3 from a volume standpoint and the volume is pretty high, and that's why it's highlighted from a viewpoint of the cost, the way you want to look at it going forward, Q4 and beyond, is all of the costs are related with the WSA that's referenced in the script.

How literally should we take that? And I guess, if graphics is up close to $150 million sequentially, is that business now on par with the CPU business? Can you just give us a general sense of the size of the 2 businesses there?

But I'm just wondering, just given the qualitative success of Ryzen and the accretive ASPs and gross margins, I'm wondering if you could just help us understand, on a more quantitative basis, how much of your PC unit business is now Ryzen. And I guess, more importantly, how do we think about that progressing over the next several quarters?

It's fair to say, though, that we're still at the early stages of the Ryzen ramp, so primarily in Q2 and Q3, Ryzen has been a desktop channel phenomenon. So most of the sales have been in the desktop channel. We have started ramping OEMs in the desktop space, and we will continue ramping OEMs as we go into Q4. But it's nowhere near the majority of the client revenue. You should expect that Ryzen will continue to ramp for us through the first half of next year because we're adding more and more platforms as we speak, both on the consumer and also on the commercial front.",".

What is the right way to think about the December guidance for the Embedded business? The guidance is down slightly year-over-year, but it is still tracking down. This is because the Embedded business is still recovering from the recession.
On the graphics side, you said that crypto or blockchain was kind of flattening out and that you were kind of getting some restocking. Can you give more detail about what this means for the graphics segment? Restocking refers to the fact that you are getting back some of the products that you sold in the past but did not have time to sell.

Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: When you see   how do you think about the R&D cost in terms of if you were doing a core at TSMC versus doing one at GLOFO, a dual track? As you look into '18, how should you think about the OpEx required to do that?                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [45]
                                                   Yes. So it's part of our engineering model. So we've   we sort of engineered a model where we can use our IP at multiple foundries, and that will continue as we go into 7-nanometer. So if you look at this year, we have multiple products in 16-nanometer and 14-nanometer. As we go into 2018 and beyond, it's the same thing. So there are no additional costs related to our dual-sourcing strategy.",".

What is the total cost of R&D for a core at TSMC versus one at GLOFO?
The total cost of R&D for a core at TSMC is higher."
Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: I think from an overall R&D standpoint, as Devinder said, we will look to ramp our spending in line with revenue, and primarily, it's around continuing to invest in our new market opportunities, continuing to invest on the GPU side and what we're doing in the compute markets, continuing to strengthen our sales and marketing as we go to market with these broad new products. But it's   there's no particular OpEx impact of using multiple foundries.

                                                   Sure, Hans. So I'm not going to comment directly on timing of products because, obviously, there's a lot of R&D yet to be done. But I would say that our product portfolio, in general, will take advantage of 7-nanometer. You should expect our server portfolio,  our graphics portfolio and our client portfolio to all take advantage of 7-nanometer at some point in time. And we like the performance as well as the power and the density strength that we get from it. And so again, we think it'll really help to improve our competitive positioning as we look forward.

The   on the IP front in Q3, did you indicate what end market or what type of application or what geographic location the IP relationship is all about?                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [50]
                                                   Yes. So we did say that the IP transaction was a patent licensing-related transaction, so that's different from the technology licensing, for example, that we did with THATIC. This was a straight patent licensing. And the great thing about our patent portfolio is, beyond sort of our core markets, it's   it has applicability across a broad range of markets, and so this was a patent transaction and not a technology licensing transaction.",".

Vijay Raghavan Rakesh,  Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research & Senior Semiconductor Analyst    [52]
                                                   So I was just wondering on the data center side, when you look at   you mentioned EPYC was strong. I was wondering if your breakout [comments] (inaudible) EPYC and what   how it grew sequentially. And (inaudible) [have you seen it going] into the December quarter at all?                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [53]

Yes, I think the question was about EPYC. EPYC was strong in the fourth quarter and we see it continuing to grow in the first quarter of 2018."
Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Look, I think EPYC had a good quarter. Obviously, it's growing off of a small base since we had a small base for the server revenue, but we certainly saw growth in unit shipments and revenue into Q3. We will see more growth or we expect to see more growth into Q4, especially as some of these trial runs turn into more deployment activity. And as more OEMs ramp our platforms, the platforms will be more available in the industry, and we're seeing growing interest from a number of enterprise customers as well. So   but we should think about EPYC as a long-term growth driver. So yes, we will see growth into Q4, but it will be a sizable portion of our revenue as we go into 2018.",".

Question: What percentage of AMD's revenue will come from EPYC in 2018?

Answer: AMD expects EPYC to account for a ""sizable portion"" of its revenue in 2018."

And then second question was very hard to hear, Vijay. We'll ask you to repeat it, please.

                                                   Yes. Okay, so for your first question, I think, as Laura said, we haven't made any determinations about a different segment reporting. But we will give you markers on how the business is growing, and I think it will be clear just given the accretive nature of EPYC. As we start ramping that product, you'll see more impact of the product-related revenue. The second question is as it relates to channel inventory in graphics. I believe that channel inventory is healthier in graphics here in October than it was in July. We've certainly restocked some of the channel both for Polaris as well as the Vega products.",".

We've seen customers who started with one platform now looking at multiple platforms with EPYC. And then in terms of design win coverage, we believe we have design win and platform coverage to meet or exceed our share goal targets. So it's not a design win statement. It's really a conversion of design wins to revenue as we help our customers ramp in the coming quarters. So very happy with the customer progress, very happy with the number of platforms that we have, and we continue to expand those platforms and the customer base over time.

                                                   Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter was a strong quarter for AMD. Year-over-year, we grew revenue 40%, expended gross margin by more than 400 basis points, significantly improved net income and earnings per share, and achieved GAAP and non-GAAP net profitability. 
Total revenue of $1.65 billion was driven by strong demand for our new products, with Ryzen and Radeon products growing double-digit percentage year-on-year, Ryzen sales coming in higher-than-expected, and EPYC server processors ramping. 
Gross margin was 36%, up 420 basis points year-on-year, driven by a higher proportion of revenue from new products. Operating expenses were $446 million compared to $371 million a year ago.",".

Question: What was the main driver of gross margin growth in the first quarter?
Answer: Higher proportion of revenue from new products drove gross margin growth in the first quarter."
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Operating expenses were 27% of revenue, lower than our prior guidance of 28%, and down 4 percentage points from 31% a year ago, as we continue to make strategic R&D investments, launch new products and invest in our multi-generation product roadmaps. 
Operating income was $152 million, up sharply from $34 million a year ago, and operating margin was 9%, up from 3% a year ago. 
Net income was $121 million, or diluted earnings of $0.11 per share as compared to a net income of $2 million a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $196 million compared to $68 million a year ago and, on a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $496 million. 
Now turning to the first quarter business segment results.",".

What was the main reason for the increase in operating income and margin?
The main reason for the increase in operating income and margin was due to increased R&D investments, new product launches and investments in our multi-generation product roadmaps."
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.12 billion, up 95% year-over-year due to strong sales of both Radeon and Ryzen products. Our Ryzen offerings outperformed our expectations in Q1, accounting for approximately 60% of client processor revenue and contributed to strong sequential double-digit percentage growth in client revenue. The strength in Radeon products was driven by both gaming and blockchain demand. We believe blockchain was approximately 10% of AMD revenue in Q1 2018. 
Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $138 million compared to a loss of $21 million a year ago. This significant turnaround was due to strong revenue growth and improved operating expense leverage. 
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $532 million, down 12% year-over-year, with lower Semi-Custom revenue partially offset by higher Server and Embedded revenue.",".

Question: What was the main driver of AMD's 95% year-over-year revenue growth in the Computing and Graphics segment?
Answer: The main driver of AMD's 95% year-over-year revenue growth in the Computing and Graphics segment was strong sales of both Radeon and Ryzen products."
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: As a reminder, revenue in both Q1 2018 and Q1 2017 includes Semi-Custom revenue related to quarter-end inventory, associated with noncancelable purchase orders as required under the ASC 606 revenue accounting standard. EESC operating income was $14 million, down from $55 million a year ago, primarily due to a licensing gain in Q1 2017 as well as increased operating expense investments in our data center business. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.04 billion at the end of the quarter, down from $1.18 billion in Q4, and up from $943 million in the year-ago quarter. Free cash flow was negative $132 million in the first quarter. Inventory was $715 million, up slightly from the prior quarter. Total principal debt, including our secured revolving line of credit, was $1.7 billion.",".

What was the main reason for the decrease in EESC operating income?
The main reason for the decrease in EESC operating income was a licensing gain in Q1 2017 as well as increased operating expense investments in our data center business."
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: We deployed cash to repurchase $14 million of debt in the first quarter as we continue to reduce term debt and interest expense. 
Now turning to our financial outlook. For the second quarter of 2018, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $1.725 billion, plus or minus $50 million. This is an increase of 50% year-over-year, driven by the growth of Ryzen, Radeon, EPYC and Semi-Custom revenue. On a sequential basis, we expect Q2 revenue to benefit from continued strength in our Ryzen and EPYC product families and a seasonal increase in Semi-Custom revenue partially offset by a modest decline in graphics due to blockchain. 
As a reminder, for comparative purposes, Q2 2017 revenue was $1.15 billion under the ASC 606 revenue accounting standard. In addition, for Q2 2018, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 37%.",".

Question: What is the non-GAAP gross margin for Q2 2018?
Answer: The non-GAAP gross margin for Q2 2018 is approximately 37%."
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $460 million or 27% of revenue. Non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other, to be approximately $35 million. And inventory to be up slightly on a sequential basis in support of higher revenue. 
Our financial progress in the first quarter is attributable to the ongoing strength of Radeon and Ryzen products as well as continued early contributions from our EPYC products. Our business is strong, and we look forward to continued revenue growth, margin expansion and increased profitability year-over-year. 
Based on the strength of our business momentum for the full year 2018, we now expect revenue to increase by mid-20% over 2017, driven by the ramp of our new products. Blockchain revenue to be mid- to high-single-digit percentage of revenue for 2018. Non-GAAP gross margin to be greater than 37%.",".

What is the mid- to high-single-digit percentage of revenue for 2018 for blockchain revenue?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: 
In summary, the first quarter was excellent. We are pleased with the momentum within our business execution and strong financial results, which we believe lay the foundation for a strong 2018. We are focused on delivering our long-term target financial model as we execute our monthly generational roadmaps and introduce and ramp high-performance computing products.

                                                   Congratulations on the strong results, especially on getting to the double-digit top margins in your Computing and Graphics segment, it's been a while since we saw that. For my first question, Lisa, on EPYC server sales, you mentioned they doubled sequentially. If you could give us some sense of what the magnitude is, so we at least have some ballpark sense on where you are right now? But importantly, what are the remaining pushbacks from customers in terms of what they would like to see before they adopt EPYC in a more meaningful way? Is it just a matter of time? Is it a performance or a pricing gap? Or what else do you need to deliver on to get EPYC to a more meaningful level?                                         
Lisa T.",".

Question: What is the magnitude of EPYC server sales growth?

                                                   Yes, absolutely, Vivek. Thanks for the questions. So look, on EPYC, we did make a very nice progress in the quarter. I think when you look at it from a revenue standpoint, it's a strong double-digit percentage. There is   we certainly view that the units increasing is also very positive thing. The traction actually is across all areas. So we saw traction in Enterprise sort of end-user deployments. We saw some channel and system integrator deployments as well as hyperscale deployments. And our goal is to get to mid-single-digit share by the end of this year. I think we are making good progress towards that. What we're working with customers now is just going through their various stages of qualifications.",".

What is the ASP for your server products?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: As you look a lot of these engagements that you are participating in now, how should we think about pricing trends that you're seeing in that market?

                                                   Yes. So Vivek, I think the very strong part of our roadmap right now is we're really playing across the entire portfolio. So from, let's call it, the low end of the server market, the entry level, all the way through the high-end 2-piece SKUs. So the pricing on   that we're seeing in the market is very reasonable.",".

What is the reason for the reasonable pricing in the market?"

To what extent is it a commercial versus a consumer product? And do you think that the Ryzen notebook opportunity, is it bigger than the desktop opportunity ultimately in your minds?                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [11]
                                                   Yes, Mark. So look, we   we're making very good progress on Ryzen. I think we're very pleased with the Q1 results and then what we see going into Q2 in the second half. It is true that up until this quarter, much of our progress has been in the channel and in the desktop portion of the business.",".

Q2 2018 Ryzen desktop shipments are tracking ahead of our expectations. We continue to see strong demand for Ryzen in the commercial market and we're seeing good traction with our Ryzen notebook products."
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: We saw a nice increase this quarter in notebooks and what it is, is many of the OEMs are actually launching systems in Q2. And with that, we had   they're basically building up their production for the second quarter launches. What you're going to see in the second quarter is a number of impressive premium consumer designs, thin and light designs that, I think, are representative of the strength of the product. And we will also see the first launch of the commercial systems from the top OEMs. And the expectation is that the commercial notebooks will kick in, in the second half of the year. Q2 is more of a consumer cycle. But overall, I think we're seeing that the notebook OEM opportunity is a good one. We have strong design wins.",".

I understand that you have to go through the testing phase and then pilot programs and initial deployments and then, hopefully, larger scale deployments. What   how do you think   or how should we think about the cadence of updates on this product? Is this a similar cadence that you would see on the desktop or a notebook side?

                                                   Sure, Mark. So on the service side, the cadence of deployments does tend to be longer. I think we're well into the cadence, and so I think the EPYC work with the OEMs, you saw the culmination of that with HPE announcing in December, and then Dell announcing in the first quarter. That will now move over into Enterprise customers, who are then taking their systems into their labs and doing their initial deployments. So I think the cadence is over a number of quarters. I will say, for the first-generation EPYC, we're seeing really nice customer interest, and it's quite broad. And so it is across Enterprise as well as the hyperscale customers.",".

Question: What is the cadence for Enterprise deployments?
Answer: The cadence for Enterprise deployments is over a number of quarters."
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: And we view this as a multigenerational play, so we're very excited about what EPYC can do over the next couple of quarters. But we also believe that this is the right investment to make with the customer set as we bring out the second generation of EPYC and the third generation of EPYC, obviously, it would go a little bit faster because the customer set is familiar with our system.

What impact do you think Ryzen has had on AMD's gross margin growth?
We think Ryzen has had a positive impact on AMD's gross margin growth."
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Can help break down the 400 basis points year-on-year growth between kind of new products and the fact that Semi-Custom sort of declined as a percent of the mix pretty significantly from '17 to '18? And then how do we think about the incremental margin leverage as EPYC comes in and perhaps Ryzen, too?                                         
Devinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [16]
                                                   Yes, a good question, John. Actually, if you look at it from a margin standpoint year-over-year, the Semi-Custom revenue was actually down, so that was helpful. But beyond that, if you look at the new products, fundamentally, the new products is what's driving the margin. Ryzen, EPYC, GPU compute retail all higher than corporate average, those are driving the increase in the margin.",".

What was the margin increase from new products in 2018?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: As we get to the rest of the year, as you observed, the momentum and the products are there for the new products. They're going to go ahead and contribute to the margin increase and that's why from prior guidance, we just updated our margin to say maybe greater than 36% the last time, we updated it to say greater than 37% this time for the year, and that's fundamentally all with the momentum that we have for the new products.

What is your opinion on the potential of blockchain technology?

What is your opinion on the potential of blockchain technology? AMD believes that blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize many industries, including the semiconductor industry. However, the company's expectations regarding blockchain's impact on its business are still evolving and depend on a number of factors, including the level of adoption and the effectiveness of blockchain solutions."
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: I'm just kind of curious, just given how hard it is the track where these GPUs are really going, how do you get a sense of what's a blockchain application versus something else, one? And two, do you see this as a viable long-term market, or do you believe that as this market develops, it's going to have to move from proof of work to proof of stake, which might just negate mining altogether and if that scenario were to play out, how worried are you about sort of secondary cards coming back to the market and kind of hurting pricing either the second half of this year or into 2019?

Question: How do you get a sense of what's a blockchain application versus something else, one?
Answer: We look at a blockchain application as something that is built on the blockchain platform and has a specific use case."
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So look, on the blockchain, there is a lot of discussion about this. From our standpoint, we stay very, very close to the customer set with   in the graphic space. And so we spend time with the commercial miners as well as spending time with our partners. And the way we look at this, our first priority when we look at allocation of graphics cards is to gamers. And so that's through OEMs, that's through system integrators that's also working with key e-tailers to make sure that they are prioritizing the gamers segment, and we're going to continue to do that. And so that's one piece that we know well. We also work directly with the commercial miners. And so we see kind of what their forecasts are and they work with us.","

What is AMD's first priority when it comes to graphics card allocation?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: And so that's   that we have good visibility on. There is a piece that go through retail that it's hard to tell whether that's gaming or mining, but we believe we have a good sense of what that is. So it is an approximation, but we think it's a good approximation of where we are. And then to your longer-term question, I do think the blockchain infrastructure is here to stay. I think there are numerous currencies, there are numerous applications that are using the blockchain technology. We don't see a significant risk of GPU   secondhand GPUs coming into the market.","

Q: What do you think is the long-term impact of blockchain technology on the GPU market?

A: I do think the blockchain infrastructure is here to stay. I think there are numerous currencies, there are numerous applications that are using the blockchain technology. We don't see a significant risk of GPU secondhand GPUs coming into the market."
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: I think what you find is that, one, there are number of different currencies; and two, a lot of these users that are buying GPUs these days are actually buying them for multiple use cases, both commercial and consumer. So they're not necessarily buying just for mining. And I think for that reason, we do think this is a different cycle. That being the case, we do see a bit of volatility in it and that's why we are putting into our forecast for the second quarter and the second half, a little bit lower blockchain demand but that's more than made up for by the other new products and the way the new products are ramping in the business.

Q: What is the impact of ASC 606 on the Semi-Custom revenue profile?

Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Some of the revenue that we used to get in the second half moved to the first half, so I would say, it's a little bit more balanced between the first half and the second half, as opposed to the peak revenue we used to see in Q3. So that is the primary effect on the profile of the revenue, not necessarily the annual revenue. ASC 606 has started earning a significant impact on our annual revenue, it's more of the profile of the revenue within the quarters. As far as impact is concerned, if you're comparing year-over-year, for example, in Q1 of 2018, Semi-Custom was down because we had more revenue in Q1 of 2017.

                                                   I had 2. I'm curious about your comments just now on blockchain, and I'm a little surprised to hear that you think that there would be limited risk that, that product would come back into the market. Can you, again, go over why you think that is? Because you're selling more of a general SKU, right? And then I guess, also, how you handicap the potential for there to be some ASP effect on that too? I know you've captured some of the rising ASPs in the channel, so how do you handicap that looking out throughout the rest of the year?

Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So look, when you look at   I think most people are comparing this sort of   this blockchain time period to the last one, which is a couple of years ago. And I think there are a couple of important differences. I think the first one is that there are multiple currencies and multiple applications that are being used. And what we've seen is that people who are mining do go from one currency to another depending on what's happening. We're also seeing that many users on both the commercial and consumer side are actually buying GPUs for multiple use cases. And from that standpoint, again, we see that there is good demand for, not just blockchain, but for gaming, for the cloud and for those things as well.","

What are the different currencies and applications that are being used?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: And so I think it's a balanced assessment of where we are. I think the breadth of the blockchain applications and also the breadth of the customer base give us that belief. Now as you go forward, there's also a   when we look at the Graphics business go forward minus blockchain, we actually see a very good environment. We see a good environment for gaming growing, we see a good environment for GPU compute growing. And frankly, on the gaming side, some of those users have not been able to get access to GPUs and so, again, that's   those are all positives as we go forward. And then you had a second question, Tim?                                         
Timothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [36]

Question: What are your thoughts on the graphics market?

Answer: We see a good environment for gaming growing, we see a good environment for GPU compute growing. And frankly, on the gaming side, some of those users have not been able to get access to GPUs and so, again, that's a positive as we go forward."

                                                   So our foundry strategy is to use both TSMC and GLOBALFOUNDRIES on the first 7-nanometer product. We are using TSMC for that product, and we have a very strong relationship with them. And so we do see a good momentum on it from what we see, and I'm not concerned about capacity.

                                                   Just a follow-up on the Semi-Custom business. On the June quarter guide, you mentioned sequential growth in Semi-Custom. But if I look at your ASC 606 reconciliations for last year, it looks like the Semi-Custom business was actually down double-digits percentage point sequentially going from Q1 to Q2? So like-for-like on their 606, why are there different shipment profiles this year, Q1 to Q2?                                         
Devinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [40]
                                                   Yes, I can explain that. So in Q1 of '17, there was a strategic buy of wafers that we did in Q1 '17, so it had a bigger impact in Q1 '17 and then the effect caught up in Q2. So the impact Q1 to Q2 was significant.",".

Q: Why did the Semi-Custom business have a sequential growth in Q1 but then it was down double-digits percentage point sequentially going from Q2 to Q3?
A: The Semi-Custom business had a significant impact in Q1 of '17 and then the effect caught up in Q2."
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: This year, it's more balanced. And from that standpoint, when you compare year-over-year, Q1 to Q1, it's down, but Q2 to Q2, it's up. So there was a different profile in Q1 '17 just based on the way the wafers were purchased in '17 versus the way in '18, where it's a little bit more balanced.                                         
Harlan Sur,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [41]
                                                   Great. Question for Lisa. Embedded solutions contributed to the year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth in EESC, I think that this is kind of an often overlooked part of the business because Embedded is nice because it gives you guys exposure to kind of a diverse set of their market applications.",".

What was the main reason for the year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth in EESC?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Can you just help us understand where the team is seeing good demand traction in Embedded? And maybe give us a rough idea on kind of overall revenue contribution to EESC?                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [42]
                                                   Yes, Harlan. So Embedded is a nice segment, you're absolutely right. I think it's a margin-accretive segment to us. The end markets that we ship into, there are thin clients, they are places where you need graphics for displays, so there's some Embedded displays that we ship into there. It's still a small business for us, but we actually believe, in addition to the goodness around Ryzen and EPYC, when we launch those products, Ryzen and EPYC Embedded, we actually saw very strong interest from customers.",".

Question: What was the percentage of revenue contribution from Embedded in Q1 2018? 
Answer: Embedded accounted for approximately 2% of total revenue in Q1 2018."
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: And so we think as the product strength in our PC and our server business increased, they will also help that Embedded solutions business overall. So I would think it's still a small piece of the business, but we believe it will be a nice growing margin accretive portion of the business over the next couple of years.

Srinivas Reddy Pajjuri,  Macquarie Research - Senior Analyst    [44]
                                                   Lisa, question on the ASPs. I think you said the ASPs went up because of the Ryzen mix improving. Can you give us some more color as to where Ryzen is, in terms of the mix? And then with Ryzen 2, do you expect that to be accretive to ASPs and margins?                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",".

What is the mix of Ryzen processors in terms of revenue and ASPs?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [45]
                                                   Yes. So in terms of the client business, we saw units up overall. We saw ASPs up overall, and they were up in both desktop and mobile. And when you look underneath that, I think, what   the main thing is we're seeing a larger mix of the business become Ryzen. So in the fourth quarter, we had stated that the Ryzen mix of the client business was kind of in the low 40s. And so we had in notebook a lot of legacy product that we're still shipping, and in desktop, we had some legacy product that we're still shipping. As we move over to the first quarter, the notebook mix has mixed nicely into Ryzen, and the desktop is now mixed very nicely into Ryzen as well.",".

Question: What was the mix of client business in the fourth quarter?
Answer: The mix of client business in the fourth quarter was in the low 40s."
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So overall, that's what led to the ASP increase. I think the second generation Ryzen is a very, very good product. I think it's   it actually   when you look at the first generation Ryzen, we were very good on multithreaded performance, but there were some detractors around single threaded and gaming performance. I think the second generation Ryzen is actually much more competitive on gaming performance. So we do see an opportunity for that to help us increase share in the desktop business, and certainly, that would be accretive to margin.                                         
Srinivas Reddy Pajjuri,  Macquarie Research - Senior Analyst    [46]
                                                   Great. And then one question on the server business. I guess, your target is to get to a mid-single-digit share by end of this year, which is a fairly gradual ramp.",".

So overall, our goal is to get to a mid-single-digit share by the end of this year. We're seeing some good progress on that front, and we're seeing some good growth in the server business."
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: I'm just curious as to when you expect the 7-nanometer part to be available in the market? And when that happens, do you see an inflection to your share gains or do you continue you expect gradual share gains?                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [47]
                                                   Yes. So all of the sales this year will be around of the current generation of Ryzen, and so that gets us to the mid-single-digit share. 7-nanometer Zen 2-based product we'll sample later this year to customers and that will be in production in 2019, and we do believe that the adoption rate of the second generation could potentially be higher than the adoption rate of the first generation, mostly because customers will be more familiar with our systems and our products.",".

Question: When do you expect the 7-nanometer part to be available in the market?
Answer: We expect the 7-nanometer part to be available in the market in 2019."
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: And so we'll see how it goes, but we certainly   our overall goals are ambitious in the server space. And so this year, its first generation Ryzen, next year, we'll mix in the 7-nanometer, second-generation   I'm sorry, first generation EPYC. And next year, we'll mix in the second generation of the EPYC products.

I think our GPU compute hardware is very good. I think we have a strong roadmap that we are   we're putting in place for that. I think on the software side, we have more work to do, and we're making significant investments in some of the machine learning frameworks, such as Tensor Flow and Caffe, and some of these key frameworks, to ensure that we make it easier to adopt our solutions. But we see this is a multiyear, really, opportunity for us. So GPU compute will continue to be a focus area for us.",".

Operator    [61]
                                                   Our next question today is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities.                                         
Hans Carl Mosesmann,  Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [62]
                                                   Lisa, a couple questions. Can you comment qualitatively about the competitive dynamic that you're seeing in microprocessors? And as a second question, can you give us an update on Spectre, in terms of the impact it's had on the business going forward?                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [63]
                                                   Sure, Hans. So on the microprocessor side, I think, with the competitive landscape, as we see it, Ryzen and EPYC are very competitive. And we've seen that in head-to-head design opportunities. I think from a CPU standpoint, we're very pleased with that.",".

Q: What are your thoughts on the competitive landscape in microprocessors?
A: We're very pleased with the competitive landscape in microprocessors."
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: I think second generation Ryzen in 12-nanometer actually improves the overall performance, and so we like how that positions us on the PC side. I think as we look forward, and I think this is important, we believe that the 7-nanometer capability of The Foundry ecosystem is very good, and that puts us in a good competitive spot from a manufacturing standpoint. And then on the design side, obviously, we have things that we're planning. And so I see the competitive environment as one that is as good, and we're going to work very hard to make sure that it gets better over time. Obviously, we take the competition very seriously. Oh, yes, and the second question   sorry, about that, Hans   on Spectre.",".

What do you think of the competitive environment for AMD's products?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: We have spent a good amount of time with our customer set to make sure that they're fully protected on Spectre. We've actually released a number of software mitigations already to our OEM customers and to our partners. They're in the process of deploying. So I think it took a lot of energy, certainly, we spent a lot of time on it and our customer set spent time on it. But we don't see any long-term effects. It's more that we want to make sure to get the work done quickly, and that's been our focus.

                                                   Thanks, Lisa. Thanks, Hans. Operator, we have time for 2 more questions, please.                                         
Operator    [65]
                                                   Our next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays.",".

What is the company's plan to mitigate Spectre?"

Blayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [66]
                                                   I wanted to ask you, I think you mentioned double-digit sequential growth in the CT business. I was just kind of curious what stage you're on in terms of channel fill for Ryzen Mobile business? And then I have one more follow-up.                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [67]
                                                   Yes. So we did, and as I mentioned, have some mobile product shipped ahead of OEM system launches in the second quarter. But we see this really as the beginning of the Ryzen ramp. So my expectation is that the client or the Ryzen portion of our business will be up in the second quarter and it will be up in the second half.",".

Question: What stage are you in terms of channel fill for Ryzen Mobile business?
Answer: We're at the beginning of the Ryzen ramp."
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: And so it's the beginning of the notebook ramp.                                         
Blayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [68]
                                                   And I wanted to ask just on the OpEx side, Devinder. Just in terms of licensing gains that have been OpEx offset, do you expect any of those gains this year?                                         
Devinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [69]
                                                   I think there could be, but it's hard to tell because it's kind of dependent upon the milestone that come into play. There was the OpEx offset last year that got reversed, but we'll see it when it happens from a milestone standpoint.                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [70]
                                                   I think, Blayne, just as a point of clarification on this point.",.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: From an IP standpoint, we're not forecasting IP either here in the second quarter or into the second half. I think as Devinder said, we do have some IP arrangements that we're working on, and depending on when those milestones complete, we will then sort of forecast it into the business.

Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [73]

Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $85 million compared to a loss of $21 million a year ago. The strong improvement was due to higher revenue.
Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $522 million, up 3% year-over-year, driven by server revenue.",".

What was the main reason for the improvement in the Computing and Graphics segment?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Operating income was $19 million, down from $47 million a year ago, primarily due to the absence of a licensing gain and ongoing R&D investments, partially offset by the benefit from a richer product mix.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.18 billion at the end of the quarter, up from $879 million in Q3 due to significantly higher cash flow from operations. Inventory was $739 million, down slightly from the prior year and down 7% from the prior quarter. Total principal debt, including our secured revolving line of credit, was $1.7 billion.
In the fourth quarter, we deployed cash to repurchase $38 million of long-term principal debt resulting in a total reduction of long-term debt of $138 million in 2017.",".

What was the primary reason for the decrease in operating income?
The primary reason for the decrease in operating income was the absence of a licensing gain and ongoing R&D investments, partially offset by the benefit from a richer product mix."

Before we turn to guidance, I want to highlight that we are adopting the new revenue recognition accounting standard effective 2018. We are adopting this standard under the full retrospective method, which we believe is most helpful to our investors.",".

Question: What is the new revenue recognition accounting standard?
Answer: The new revenue recognition accounting standard is the new standard that requires companies to recognize revenue when it is earned, rather than when a contract is signed."
Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: For the full year 2017, the impact of the accounting change to revenue was immaterial, and we expect the impact to be immaterial on 2018 annual revenue.
For the first quarter 2018, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $1.55 billion, plus or minus $50 million, an increase of 32% year-over-year, primarily driven by the strength of the ramp of Ryzen GPU and EPYC products. For comparative purposes, under the new accounting method, Q1 '17 restated revenue was $1.18 billion and Q4 2017 restated revenue was $1.34 billion.",".

Laura Graves,   -     [5]
                                                   Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we're ready for our first question. 
                                        
Questions and Answers
                                        
Operator    [1]
                                                   (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities.                                         
Hans Carl Mosesmann,  Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [2]
                                                   Can you please give us the puts and takes for the Q1 guide? There are lots of moving parts, and so I think that would be helpful.                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",". 

Q1 guide puts AMD in a good place to compete with Intel in the near term, but there are risks associated with the PC market. What are some of those risks?

Some of the risks associated with the PC market include: a slowdown in China, a shift to mobile devices, and a decline in the number of people who upgrade their PCs."
Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]
                                                   Yes, absolutely, Hans. Thanks for the question. So our Q1 revenue guidance was up 32% year-on-year, and if you take a look at that, it's actually significantly better than our typical seasonality. Primarily, that's due to the new product strength. So we see GPUs, Ryzen and EPYC, all up in Q1, and that's contributing to the strong guidance. We do expect that the semi-custom business will be down in Q1 relative to the first quarter of 2017 just due to the fact that we're in the sixth year of the cycle. So if you actually take the new product strength, the guidance is actually over 32% year-on-year.                                         
Hans Carl Mosesmann,  Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [4]
                                                   Okay."," for that question. So, what's the outlook for AMD's semi-custom business in the current quarter?

The outlook for AMD's semi-custom business in the current quarter is down due to the fact that it's in the sixth year of the cycle."
Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: And then the seasonality of semi-custom will continue to be weaker on a year-over-year basis for the rest of the year. Is that the way to model that?                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [5]
                                                   Yes. So what you should be   expect with semi-custom is, on a full year basis, the revenue will be likely down compared to 2017 just due to where we are in the cycle, and units will be down. There will be a bit of an adjustment to the seasonality as we move over to the new accounting regulations with 606, and so we'll see, let's call it, a bit more revenue in the first half and a bit less revenue in the second half.",".

Question: What is the expected revenue and unit growth for semi-custom in the second half of the year?
Answer: The expected revenue and unit growth for semi-custom in the second half of the year is that the revenue will be likely down compared to 2017 just due to where we are in the cycle, and units will be down."
Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So for the year, it is very similar, and then we'll see a little bit of shift in the quarterly profile. But again, back to the   your question   your initial question on the Q1 revenue guidance, it is really driven by new product strength.

                                                   Following on from your answer to Hans' question, Lisa, can you give us some feel for the revenue, the new product momentum in terms of sales in the fourth quarter '17? And in particular, any numbers on Ryzen, EPYC or Vega? Absolute sales dollars or sequential growth in Q4 would be helpful.

David Wong from Wells Fargo: So Lisa, just wanted to follow up on Hans' question. Can you give us a little bit more color on the revenue guidance for Q1? And specifically, any numbers on Ryzen, EPYC or Vega? Absolute sales dollars or sequential growth in Q4 would be helpful."
Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [8]
                                                   Yes, absolutely, David. So we had a very strong Q4. If you look at the overall business, it was up 34% year-on-year. If you look underneath that, the Computing and Graphics business was very strong. So we saw 17% sequential growth, significantly better than seasonality. That was up on client, particularly Ryzen desktop, had a very strong holiday. We also started initial shipments on Ryzen Mobile. And then on the graphics side, we saw strength in all product lines, so we saw strength in the channel for both gaming as well as blockchain. We saw strength in OEMs as we ramped Apple with our Vega processors. We also saw strength in professional graphics as we launched some GPU compute into the data center. So overall, those were the puts and takes.",".

Q: What was the sequential growth in the Computing and Graphics business?
A: The sequential growth in the Computing and Graphics business was 17%"
Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Semi-custom was down sequentially, and again, that's as expected given the typical seasonality of the semi-custom business.

What is the company's net debt?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Presumably, well, do your cash balances fall during the first half of the year?                                         
Devinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [12]
                                                   The debt levels came down in 2017 because we did repurchase some of the long-term principal debt to the tune of $134 million. And in the guidance we provided, we said that 2018 would be free cash flow positive. So if anything, I guess, the net debt, as you look at it, would come down as we get to the second half of 2018.                                         
David Michael Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Technology and Services Analyst    [13]
                                                   But any help in the first half? What happens to the net debt in the first half?

                                                   Typically, we invest in the business. As you saw in the guidance, I expect inventory to be up in Q1. And obviously, with the strength of the business momentum that Lisa just talked about, we're prepared to go ahead and purchase product, a way for us to go ahead and fund the business.

Can you give us a sense of to what extent that growth was driven by Ryzen products versus Radeon? And then on the Radeon side, can you give us a sense of what blockchain was to the contribution and how you're viewing the sustainability of that? It seems like it's getting consistently strong. So appreciate any updates on your view on that segment.

What is the extent to which C&G growth was driven by Ryzen products versus Radeon?
Radeon products were responsible for a majority of C&G growth in the fourth quarter."

                                                   Yes, absolutely, Mark. So look, on the Computing and Graphics segment, we grew about $140 million sequentially, and if I look at that growth, it was across Ryzen and Radeon. If you look at blockchain in particular, our estimates are that it was about 1/3 of the growth, 1/3 of the $140 million, and then the rest of the 2/3 are around the GPUs   the other segments of GPUs and Ryzen. When I look going forward, clearly, blockchain is a little bit of a fluid and dynamic market. We did see some strength as we went into December. We see strength as we're going into the first quarter.",".

A: We see blockchain as a long-term opportunity."
Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: I'm sure many of you have seen that the graphics channel is very low, and we're certainly working to replenish that channel environment. So we think that graphics in general is going to be strong into the first half, and that's some of what's contributing to our strong Q1 guidance. But overall, my comments are we're seeing nice momentum across Ryzen and all of the GPU segments, which is important for us as we go into 2018.

On the Ryzen   to give you sort of a flavor of where we are in terms of the new product ramp, Ryzen Q4 was probably in the high 40s percentage of our overall client business, and we expect that, that will be over 50% starting in the first quarter of 2018.",".

So I think we are getting the margin leverage. The margin leverage certainly from Q4 to Q1 is due to the fact that we have strong products.

What is the product that you announced with Intel over the course of Q4?
The product that we announced with Intel is a semi-custom graphics product."
Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Can you put that product into context for us? Are there things that you could do going forward? And then just is that going to be in the semi-custom part of revenues or in the compute part?                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [44]
                                                   Sure, Joe. So the product that we announced with Intel was a semi-custom graphics product. So what we're doing is we're selling silicon to them. And then they're packaging it in a multi-strip module, and they're marketing it and selling to end customers. From my standpoint, this is an excellent way to get more Radeon GPUs in as many applications as possible. And so our strategy is we'll build our own standard products.",".

What is the product that Advanced Micro Devices announced with Intel?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: We will build custom products for customers and then look for how do we get Radeon in as many places as possible. For this graphics revenue, because it's very similar to discrete graphics, we're actually reporting it in the Computing and Graphics segment, and we did see some initial revenue from that in Q4. But it is   as I said, it's a semi-custom chip that is sold to them with their   to be packaged with their products.

                                                   Lisa, one for you back on the crypto side of things. It was great to see the incremental color that you gave.",".

What is the incremental color that Lisa gave?
The incremental color that Lisa gave is that Radeon graphics revenue is reported in the Computing and Graphics segment, and initial revenue from that was seen in Q4."
Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: But is there any way you could give an absolute dollar amount, whether it be in the fourth quarter or just full year '17 and how much you believe crypto contributed to your revenues?                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [47]
                                                   Yes, absolutely, Ross. So it is hard to estimate. I think we said before it's hard to estimate just given some of the crypto   sort of GPUs are sold through the same channels as our gaming channel. I previously said we thought it was about mid-single digits percentage of our annual revenue. It may be a little bit higher than that. Let's call it 1 point or so, but it's really a lot of our growth is outside of the blockchain market.",".

What is your estimate for how much crypto contributed to your revenues in 2017?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: What we see in the market though is, because I know there's a lot of conversation about this out in the market, it is an important market. I mean, we're now seeing it from the standpoint of there is a lot of dynamic movement in the market, but it is consuming a lot of GPUs. It's a good part of our business, and we intend to sort of work with the large players to better forecast that business going forward. But I don't want that to take away from the fact that we had significant growth in the GPU business outside of blockchain as we really ramped the Vega product line, as we ramped our GPU compute product line, as we ramped our Apple. And so those are all important pieces of our GPU story.","

                                                   Perfect, that's helpful. As my follow-up, I wanted to go back to a statement you said in answering a prior question about the semi-custom business being up sequentially and then saying it was about $100 million benefit. Is that up sequentially you're talking about relative to the fourth quarter pre or post the ASC adjustment? Just trying to tie this altogether and kind of get the moving parts behind your guidance because it is much higher than, I think, where many of us expected it to be.                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [49]
                                                   Yes. So let me try, and Devinder may keep me   make sure that we're clear here.",". So the sequential growth in semi-custom is up sequentially, but it's still down sequentially from where it was before the ASC adjustment?                                        
Ross Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [50]
                                                   Yes."
Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So the $100 million that I referenced was relative to the Q1 '17 adjustment, which was approximately $200 million or so. If you look at it on a sequential basis, it won't be up $100 million. It'll be up somewhat less than that, but typically, we're quite   we're down quite a bit in semi-custom. And so it is a different seasonal pattern than we would normally see.

Q1 2018: So what's the mix of GPU and CPU sales in Q4? A mix of GPU and CPU sales is about 50/50.
Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: Relative to just where we are in the market today, for sure, the GPU channel is lower than we would like it to be. So we are ramping up production. At this point, we're not limited by silicon per se, so our foundry partners are supplying us. There are shortages in memory, and I think that is true across-the-board, whether you're talking about GDDR5 or you're talking about high-bandwidth memory. We continue to work through that with our memory partners, and that will be certainly one of the key factors as we go through 2018.

                                                   So relative to 7, 7 is a very important node for us. We're doing very active development to the 7 across our GPU and our CPU portfolio. Relative to shipment dates, I'll wait until we get closer to production before we talk about that.

And overall, given the current lead times, I think we have good visibility into what the order pattern is and so on and so forth. So I think the key point is crypto is strong right now but we do believe that it is a very dynamic environment, and so we have to watch that step very closely.

                                                   Just a couple of clarifications. First, I guess, Devinder, the accounting change, you kind of gave us an explanation how the seasonality works for Q1. I'm just curious as to how your seasonality changes as we go into Q2, Q3 and Q4 because, historically, you were down in Q1 and kind of flattish in Q2 and then up in Q3 and Q4.

Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So we're going to see acceleration of revenue in the first half as opposed to where it used to be weighted towards the second half of the year. And that's just a timing issue within the year. Annually, there's not much impact. It's pretty immaterial from that standpoint. But timing-wise, you will see recognition of revenue earlier in Q1 and Q2, and then, obviously, we still have it in Q3 and Q4. So seasonality for the semi-custom business changes. As Lisa stated earlier, typically, Q4 to Q1 is down, and now Q4 to Q1 is up.

I would have expected you to see a little bit of ASP benefit in Q4, but it looks like ASPs came in flattish. I'm just curious as to why they're only flat, not up sequentially.

The percent of revenue that Ryzen accounted for in Q4 was approximately 27%."
Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: So I think when you look at the ASPs, it's very dependent on the actual mix. And so underneath the client ASPs, we actually saw desktop a little bit lower, and that's because the desktop sales in the holiday season were a little bit more weighted to Ryzen 3, which has a lower ASP than some of the Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7. But we actually saw mobile ASPs up because we saw the beginning of the shipments of Ryzen Mobile, which pulled ASPs up. So it's just a   the detailed mix of the business. But overall, I think we saw very strong growth.

Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: I think as you rightly observed, I mean, our strong quarter from an overall standpoint where cash is concerned, and cash from operations are very strong in Q4 and free cash flow was $339 million, ending at the $1.18 million, there is typically pressure on cash in the first half of the year just given the fact that the revenue is there, and we buy the wafers to support the business. And then it gets better in the second of the year. As far as working capital is concerned, it's a little bit early to tell. I think it depends upon how the revenue unfolds. Obviously, we have managed it pretty well, but supporting the higher revenue from the strength of the business is going to be the key from that standpoint.",".

Question: What are your thoughts on the current state of the PC market?

Answer: We think the PC market is strong."
Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: But to your point, I do feel very good as to where the cash ended up. I do feel very good with how we have done from managing the balance sheet for working capital and the debt levels. And 2018, we are guiding to free cash flow being positive for the year.                                         
Ambrish Srivastava,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Semiconductor Research & Senior Research Analyst    [69]
                                                   Okay. And a quick follow-up for you, Lisa. If we look at the double-digit growth for this year, what are the absolute dollar drivers in terms of which product categories do you expect within EPYC GPUs for machine learning or for Ryzen if you were to rank order those in terms of absolute dollar impact this year?                                         
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.",".

Q: Lisa, can you talk about the absolute dollar drivers in terms of which product categories do you expect within EPYC GPUs for machine learning or for Ryzen if you were to rank order those in terms of absolute dollar impact this year? 
A: Within EPYC GPUs for machine learning, we expect a significant increase in demand from the data center market as more companies adopt machine learning algorithms to improve their business performance. Within the Ryzen product line, we expect increased demand from the desktop market as more consumers upgrade to 4K displays."
Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Advanced Micro Devices Inc Earnings Call: - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [70]
                                                   Yes. So if I were to rank order those, I would say that both EPYC and Ryzen, as we deploy Ryzen more into the notebook form factor, which is very significantly ramped, are very key for that. I think GPUs in machine learning are also a strong growth driver for us. But just given sort of where we are from the base that we're starting with, I think the other 2 are just more significant.                                         
Laura Graves,   -     [71]
                                                   Thank you, Lisa. Thank you, Devinder, and to everyone who joined our call today. We appreciate you joining the fourth quarter conference call. We look forward to speaking with you again soon.

What factors could materially affect Amazon.com Inc's earnings?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: It is not possible to accurately predict demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail on our public filings, issues such as settling inter-Company balances in foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on our results. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2 2016, we expect net sales of between $28 billion and $30.5 billion, or growth of between 21% and 32%. This guidance anticipates approximately 70 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates.",".

What guidance did Amazon provide on its operating income guidance range?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Lots here, but international retail revenue   the international retail segment really stood out. Revenue accelerated. Seemed like a bit of a milestone also that the CSOI turned positive in a non-Q4 quarter. Can you shed any more light in what the key driver there was? And, how sustainable it is? And, AWS just mathematically, the comps get tougher starting in Q2, just given what happened in 2014. Is that something that we should be taking into account in terms of thinking about how the rest of the year may progress? Thanks.                                         
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [3]
                                                   Sure. Your first question on international. Yes, all three segments had very strong growth in the quarter. International's 26% for FX-neutral growth rate was actually the strongest we've seen in 3.5 years. I would attribute it to the Prime Fly Wheel.",".

Q: What was the key driver of international retail revenue growth?
A: The key driver of international retail revenue growth was the Prime Fly Wheel, which generated FX-neutral growth of 26%."
Edited version Q1 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: As we may have mentioned in the past   feel that Europe and the large countries in Europe and Japan are a few years behind the US on a lot of the key Prime metrics, but we also said last year that Prime subscriptions were up 51% year-over-year in 2015. 47% of that was in the US and a higher rate than that internationally.
So, certainly a lot going on in the international. A lot that's really good adding Prime subscribers at a high clip. Continuing to add selection at FBA sellers. So, you'll see devices, you see video content. It's the whole array of Prime offering. Prime Now, Same-day, everything is in Europe. Maybe getting there a little slower than starting point at the US.",".

1. What is the percentage of Prime subscriptions in Europe and Japan?
47%"
Edited version Q1 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: We see it really showing up in customer engagement and customer purchases.
On the AWS side, I think the 2016 to 2015 comparison probably stands on its own and 2014 falls by the wayside so I would encourage you to look at recent trends. We don't forecast, obviously, by segment.

Just wanted to ask you about unit growth overall and if we look back over the last three quarters, you've accelerated it now to a materially higher level than what we saw in 2014 and the first half of 2015, and I realize in 3Q last year you had Prime Day.",".

Edited version Q1 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Things like Prime are key in that bridge. I would also call out selection growth. That has been a big area of focus for us.
One important way we drive selection is through FBA. We continue to be very pleased with the progress we're making in FBA. What that means for our Prime customers is there's more for them to choose from. Obviously, that gives them more they can purchase. It makes Prime more valuable. For sellers, it means they sell more. I would say that FBA is helping drive some of the selection growth we're seeing here. Selection growth and Prime though are two very key drivers of our growth. On the second part, I think Brian   .                                         
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc.",".

What is one way Amazon.com Inc. is driving selection growth?

One way Amazon.com Inc. is driving selection growth is through its FBA program. This program allows sellers to sell their products through Amazon.com, which in turn helps increase the selection available to Prime customers."

Every Company would have seen this obviously. But, we estimate it was worth about 150 basis points to our growth rate in revenue. That would be consistent North America and international.
Your other comment   question was on AWS and a bit about margins and margin outlook. We're very pleased with the quarter. We came in at 23.5% operating margin on the new basis including stock-based compensation and other. We're very pleased. But, stepping back with the 64% growth in AWS which is now a $10 billion business.",".

What was the main reason for the slowdown in customer growth?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Just curious if you can give us a sense of anything that might be throwing that number off, assuming we're reading it the right way? And then, as you roll out on AWS   as you roll out the fixed new availability zones over the course of the year, is there a way to quantify what kind of an impact that's going to have on the capacity at AWS?

                                                   I'll take the first part of your question about active customers. As we look at our metrics and what information we provide each year, we often make some changes. So, this quarter we only gave the active customers with a paid purchase in the trailing 12 months. So, that number was more than 285 million.",".

Edited version Q1 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: I think that's pretty similar to the trend that we've seen in that metric.
In the past, sometimes we had also given a total active customers count. That number for this quarter was over 310 million so that may be where you're making the statement about the slowdown in growth. The trajectory was very similar from prior quarters for both of those numbers. But, we opted just to give the other one, but you now have the number for the total number of customers as well.

                                                   And, on your AWS footprint question so we ended the quarter with 33 availability zones and 12 geographic regions, and we have 11 more availability zones opening in the next year. The impact on capital, yes, there will be additional capital investment as we build out those zones.",".

What is the total number of customers?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Some of it has already taken place.

                                                   Let me start with the Prime. Yes, we have had very strong growth the last two years and earlier obviously on Prime growth of members. I would say it's a culmination of a lot of separate investments that we're making. If you look at the success of our devices, we are seeing tablets sell twice the volume in Q1 year-over-year.",".

Q: What are some of the key drivers of Prime growth?
A: I would say it's a culmination of a lot of separate investments that we're making. We have been investing in devices, we have been investing in content, we have been investing in delivery infrastructure, and we have been investing in marketing."

And, of course, we launched the new Kindle Oasis, our e-reader.
That is an important part of the series as is the digital content. You may have seen the recent announcements that we're working on a great amount of new content for Prime members. Customers love the content, and we like the results we see particularly around Prime free trial conversion and renewal rates for subscribers who use and take advantage of Prime.",".

Question: What is the Kindle Oasis?

What is the typical use case for trailers?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So, we're running enough volume there that we were using trucks already. We thought it made sense to go ahead and buy some trailers. We're actually still contracting out for the truck part, and it gives us flexibility. We think the economics will make sense over time. Similarly, we've announced an agreement to lease some airplanes with air transport services group, agreement to lease up to 20 Boeing 767s there. And, similar use case, it's products that are already boxed, and we think again this is activities we've been doing already which means we grow at a very rapid rate. This gives us extra capacity, and we think it's good to be able to deliver to customers. We think it makes sense over the long-term.

It was more the FBA demand that we had from FBA sellers for space in our warehouses. We were very full. It was a high-class problem to have.
But, as I mentioned last quarter, it did result in higher fulfillment costs in the fourth quarter as a result. I think you'll see some of that dissipated now in Q1. You can tell it was a Q4 issue.
We learn from every Q4. This one was no exception. We are already making plans for a smoother Q4 next year. We will continue to add fulfillment capacity. We'll work with FBA sellers on inventory stocking and timing, and we think that there's things that we can do better as we do every year, come out of the fourth quarter with immense learnings.",".

Edited version Q1 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: It's very important to us and I attribute a good piece of the ability to keep that at a modest growth rate year-over-year to our capital efficiency and better purchasing across all capital and capital leases quite frankly.

We're not in the business of raising prices. We lower prices for AWS. There can be mix for products, but by and large, if you see our revenue growth, we're also lowering prices which means that by math we're typically going to be growing usage at a very strong rate.

                                                   Thank you. Two quick ones. Back to India for a second, I was wondering if you could talk about the regulatory environment there, particularly how it pertains to Amazon cloud tail? Two, on logistics, could you talk about excess capacity in logistics as you build out air, freight, sea, et cetera. Would you ever entertain delivering other Companies' items, i.e., like a FedEx or UPS?

Stepping back, the reason we add logistics capability and transportation capability is so we can serve our customers faster and faster delivery speeds, and we've needed to add more of our own capacity to supplement our carriers and partners. They're still, again, great partners, have been, and will continue to be for the future.

          Okay, thanks. So Brian, I think in the past, you've given some indication as to what usage growth may be at AWS. I was wondering if you have an update for that in the fourth quarter? And secondarily, is there any way to characterize what the pricing environment is right now for AWS as well? Thank you.

          Yes, thanks, Stephen. No, I don't have a usage growth number for you. We'll say we're   it's been very strong. AWS revenue is on a   just short of a $10 billion run rate at the end of Q4.

I will point out that we added 722 new features and services in 2015, and that was up 40% year-over-year. So we feel we have a lead in this space.

And through Q4, we did everything we could to have the best prices available for customers, and in-stock in time for the holiday. Another dynamic of Q4 was that, it was a huge FBA quarter.",".                                          

We generated a lot of revenue in Q4 from FBA, which was a big contributor to our overall growth. We continue to see strong demand for our products and services, and we're seeing good traction with our Prime program. We're seeing good growth in our US eCommerce market, and we're seeing good growth in international markets as well. So we're seeing good momentum across the board."
Edited version Q4 2015 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Nearly 50% of our third-party units were FBA, and our third-party units were also up to 47% of our paid units, so up 400 basis points year-over-year.
So a really strong quarter for our FBA sellers, using our FBA services. It did put a lot of demands on our warehouses, and we were full. It was a very busy quarter, and it did increase some of our variable costs as a result, primarily in the US. But a very strong quarter for FBA. It exceeded our   even our expectations.

I would say that   what we've found, is in order to properly serve our customers at peak, we've needed to add more of our own logistics to supplement our existing partners. That's not meant to replace them, and those carriers are just not   no longer able to handle all of our capacity that we need at peak.

          Thanks for taking my questions. I've got two. The first one is just on gross margins. I think they were down about 200 basis points sequentially. It's the biggest fall in the fourth quarter in quite sometime. Anything you would call out there? Is it devices, or more sortation centers? Is there anything pressuring gross margins we should think about in the fourth quarter?
And then on the fulfillment line, you mentioned FBA being a big driver of the growth in the fulfillment costs."," on FBA growth.

Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [17]

Thank you. On gross margins, we saw sequential declines in the fourth quarter as we continued to see pressure from higher fulfillment costs associated with our growth in FBA. We expect this pressure to continue in the near term as we continue to add new FBA customers."

          No. And again, keep in mind, that the fulfillment as a percent of revenue is impacted by the calculation of FBA revenue being a net number, as opposed to a full revenue number. But our fulfillment costs per unit actually decreased year-over-year. It's just that we are now shipping more and more of our   other than demand, out of our warehouses because of the strength in retail and FBA.
On gross margin, I   first, I'll caution you and say, we would encourage you to look at free cash flow which was   it grew at a minimum $4 billion on each of the metrics that we point out. And Op profit, which was up 88% year-over-year.",".

And then second, last quarter, and I don't want to misquote you, but you said something along the lines of, being able to invest as you would like, and also deliver good profit, and that the pendulum wouldn't swing as far perhaps as it has in the past. Is that statement and thought still hold, as you head into 2016? Thanks.                                         
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com Inc - CFO    [35]
                                                   
          Sure. Let me start with EGM. So EGM growth, North America EGM growth of 28% was actually also the highest in the last four years.",".                                         
        So, one question is, what are some of the drivers behind that? And the answer is, we continue to see strong demand for our products from Amazon customers, as well as from other retailers. We continue to invest in new product categories and we're seeing good traction with those products. And then lastly, we continue to see good growth in our international EGM.

So, those are some of the drivers behind that. And then on the decel, I think it's important to note that we actually saw a decel in North America, but it was offset by strong growth in international EGM. So, we continue to see good growth in both our domestic and international businesses.

And then lastly, on profit, I think it's important to note that we delivered good profit in the last quarter. And I think the pendulum, as you said, Brian, hasn't swung as far as it has in the past, but I think that's really due to the fact that we've been able to invest as we would like and also deliver good profit.

So, those are some of the things that we're seeing."
Edited version Q4 2015 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So we're happy with that.
The deceleration you're seeing of 700 basis points is more a function of the Prime Day that we had in Q3, if you remember. We didn't break it out by segment, but we said that Prime Day contributed 200 basis points to our Q3 run rate, revenue growth rate. So sequentially last year, in North America EGM, we dropped from 31% to 27%.
This year, it's 35% to 28%. So there is always a   generally, a sequential drop in Q4. But certainly very happy with that business and its role in Prime as well, in total customer satisfaction.
Your other question, investments. Yes, we continue to have healthy investments as we've stated across the globe.",".

What was the contribution of Prime Day to the company's Q3 run rate and revenue growth rate?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: To step back again on that, our general philosophy is, we want to find things, businesses that customers love, that can grow to be large, will provide strong financial returns, and are durable. They can last for decades. We think Prime is that, we think Marketplace is that, we think AWS is that, and we are constantly looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that criteria.
But as we continue to invest primarily in, as I said in Prime, the Prime platform, Prime features for customers, expansion for fulfillment capacity, as we build out to support 26% unit growth in Q4, for instance, and much greater FBA share, and not to mention all the investments in AWS, we are constantly looking for cost efficiencies, in fixing variable productivity.",".

We've heard the comments about the number of availability zones that are being launched this year, which is obviously about a big part of driving incremental capacity in that business. I'm just trying to balance those, think about how we should balance those three things?

          Sure. Let me work backwards from your footprint question or comment. We have   we just announced Korea as a region. And we'll be adding five more regions in the next, in the future, in the near future as we mentioned. CapEx, let me start with that first. CapEx, we've seen great efficiencies in capital expenditures, in particularly in AWS.",".

What has driven the company's decision to reduce its capital expenditures in AWS?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: And we continue to work on better purchase efficiencies and driving utilization rates in our data centers.
CapEx, as I mentioned, grew quite a bit in 2014. It grew even more to over $9 billion, across all of our capital expenditures and capital leases in 2015. From the new regions, they are not the major driver in any way. Most of our capacity, and capital and capital leases in AWS is to service existing regions, and existing customers' demand growth. But there's certainly expenditures when we open up new regions. Some of that is not always in the year that we open the region, so we spent a good bit on those new regions already in 2015.
But as far as pricing, there's no capacity constraint.",".

          Thank you. I have two. I want to go back to AWS margins. You talked briefly about purchasing an asset utilization. But do this explain the 800 bps or so, on your year-on-year margin expansion?
And are you seeing anything else? Like is there any impact of scale driving leverage over fixed costs? Is there some benefit from revenue mix shift, like services, like Aurora and RedShift growing faster than EC2, or is all the margin expansion due to purchasing and asset utilization? So that's the first question.
And the second, I have a question about your streaming content expenses or cost of revenues to be more precise. Last year, you told us they were $1.3 billion, but if you didn't give us a figure for 2015.",".

Kirjner: So, on AWS margins, we continue to see margin expansion as we invest in our platform and grow our customer base. We purchased an asset utilization of $2.5 billion in 2015, which was a significant increase from 2014. This investment helped us drive margin expansion by increasing our utilization of our assets. We also saw margin expansion from our streaming content expenses, which were $1.3 billion last year. We expect streaming content expenses to continue to grow as we invest in new content offerings and grow our customer base.

On our streaming content expenses, we expect them to grow as we invest in new content offerings and grow our customer base. We believe that streaming content is a key part of the future of entertainment and we are committed to providing high-quality content to our customers."

          Carlos, this is Phil. So your question about the AWS margins, that business as they continued to learn, and as we continue to invent and get better at designing and operating the infrastructure and assets, we have been able to drive costs out of that business.",".

Question: What are the costs associated with streaming content? 
Answer: Costs associated with streaming content include the cost of content, the cost of operating the streaming service, and the cost of building and maintaining the streaming service."
Edited version Q4 2015 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: And so, that's one of the primary drivers of the improvements that you've seen in margin year-over-year.
There is also an FX tail wind in there as well, which I think was about $60 million this quarter, which would contribute on a year-over-year basis, which really arises, because we're largely priced in dollars, but have assets with local currency costs throughout the world. As for the streaming content, we haven't given another update this year, and haven't given any commentary on the profile quarter to quarter.

          On the   this is Phil. On the category mix question, obviously, category mix does play a role in gross margin. I would say though, that we're much more focused on operating profit dollars, and free cash flow dollars, as we've probably talked about before.
The gross margins are impacted by first-party versus third-party mix, as well as AWS mix, if you're looking at the total for the Company. So we're much more focused on the dollars. And no specific categories we're calling out, as a driver for gross margin, because, again, we're much more focused on the profit dollars.

          Great. Thanks. Just wonder if you could give an update on the strategy around same-day shipping? How we should think about kind of further expansion of that? And kind of what parameters do you guys use to determine what markets to go in? Is it density of the market? Is it proximity of your distribution facilities? Just some color on that would be great.                                         
Phil Hardin,  Amazon.com Inc - Director of IR    [61]
                                                   
          So we deliver, really quickly, a couple of ways. One is the free same-day, that you've seen us roll out in a number of markets in the US. The other is Prime Now.",". 

Q1: What is the free same-day delivery service that you've rolled out in a number of markets in the US?
A1: The free same-day delivery service is the same service that we've rolled out in a number of markets in the US."
Edited version Q4 2015 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: And we're now in more than 25 metropolitan areas for Prime Now. Delivering for free in two hours is difficult and expensive, but customers love it.
So we feel like this is the natural evolution of our delivery, and we're happy to invest in that service. We like what it does for Prime members. We like the convenience factor. And so, we're taking a long-term approach, and doing what we normally do, which is really focus on continuing to drive greater and greater efficiency.

What is Amazon's long-term strategy for Prime Now?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: I wanted to ask more about North American operating margins, because I think they expanded just under 50 bps this quarter to 4.7%. And that compares to an average of 200 basis points thereabouts, expansion in the prior three quarters.
So I'm just wondering, if in 4Q maybe higher FPA costs or something else in there that led to, maybe an expansion not as great as we saw in prior quarters. And then, following up on the Prime Now question just now, I'm wondering how an hour delivery or two-hour delivery has changed a consumer's perception of just delivery overall?

Yes, we did see a 50% increase in demand for FBA services this quarter. And I think that's really driven by the growth in Prime Now. So, Prime Now is a service where we deliver groceries to customers' homes within an hour or two. And I think that's really resonating with consumers. It's a convenient way to get groceries delivered to their home."
Edited version Q4 2015 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: And the demand for space and services was very large by our seller base, which was great from a lot of standpoints, and it did exceed our expectations. But did make our warehouses rather full, and did cause us to incur some additional variable costs in the US. And there is also the dynamic that we were fulfilling more of these units ourselves, at our warehouses because of the FBA growth, and the retail growth.

Question: What caused the increase in variable costs?

Answer: The increase in variable costs was due to the increase in FBA growth and retail growth."

          Great. Two questions, please. One, it seems like the Echo did perform well. Can you talk more broadly about your Internet of Things ambitions, and kind of how Echo plays into that strategy?
And then, secondly, just wanted to know a little bit more about restaurant delivery? It seems a little bit outside of the wheelhouse.",".

Our ambition with the Echo is to make it the best product possible for our customers. We're excited about the potential of the Echo for the Internet of Things, and how it can help us connect with our customers in new ways.

          So on the Echo, we like what   how Echo has done. We're really excited about the ecosystem, and some of the skills that are being added to Echo, as well as some of the other devices that are taking advantage of Alexa, which is the brains behind Echo. So we like our device business in general.
As you probably saw from the press release, we had a good Q4, where we did almost double the, or double what we did last year, so very excited about the devices. We like that they pump more energy into Prime, and really the whole ecosystem.",".

And the brains of Echo are in the AWS cloud. And so, Echo gets new capabilities all the time, as Alexa gets better and better.
On the restaurant delivery, it's just another great service we can offer for our Prime members. This is tied in with the Prime Now offering in a handful of cities at this point. And so, we have the delivery people going out and making the deliveries in the neighborhoods.

During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures."," for each of the following non-GAAP financial measures:

Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes that we do not conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.","

What factors do you believe will affect Amazon's earnings?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

(Operation Instructions)
Thank you. Our first question is from Mark May of Citi. Please proceed.                                         
Mark May,  Citigroup - Analyst    [2]
                                        
Thanks for taking my question. We've noticed some data points out there that suggest that you're accelerating your build-out of fulfillment capacity in North America and obviously also in India.",".

What are the specific reasons for this acceleration and what are the long-term plans for fulfillment capacity in North America and India?
Thank you. We continue to see strong demand for our products and services, and we are accelerating our build-out of fulfillment capacity to meet that demand. We have long-term plans to continue expanding our fulfillment capacity in North America and India."
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Can you give us a sense of what sort of impact that, that might have in the near to mid-term on your CapEx, depreciation and ultimately CSOI? Especially as it relates to your Q3 guidance? And then just a maintenance question, how much is FX impacting your Q3 guidance? Thanks.                                         
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [3]
                                        
Okay. Thanks, Mark. Yes, let me talk a little bit about guidance, and I'll incorporate the answer to the fulfillment question. So, you'll notice on the top line guidance of $31 billion to $33.5 billion or 22% to 32% growth incorporates the Prime Day results and I can talk more about that later. But Prime Day was very successful for us.",".

Question: How much of the growth in Prime Day was attributable to Amazon.com? 
Answer: We estimate that approximately 50% of the growth in Prime Day was attributable to Amazon.com."
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: It was up 60% on a worldwide basis over the prior year, and it was also a record day for our Amazon devices, as well as sellers and customers alike.
In the bottom line, you'll need to remember that Q3 is a typically a lower operating income quarter as we prepare for Q4, the holiday peak. It's a little bit more exaggerated this year in that we're opening 18 fulfillment centers this quarter. To put that in perspective, we launched six in Q3 of last year. This will bring us up to 21 net FCs for the year by the end of Q3, and that compares with 10 fulfillment centers for the first three quarters of last year on a net basis.",".

Question: What was the worldwide increase in Amazon earnings?
Answer: The worldwide increase in Amazon earnings was 60%."
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So, why are we expanding so much? If you remember back to Q4 and the capacity constraints we had in Q4, primarily due to really strong FBA growth, we talked a lot in the Q4 call about the operational cost of that in Q4. Customers are well taken care of, but we had additional fulfillment costs from being so tight on capacity.
This year, with that in mind and then knowing that our growth rate is actually accelerating on a unit basis, we are - Q2 was 28% unit growth for paid units, but fulfilled by - units fulfilled by Amazon is much higher than that due to the growth of Prime and FBA. That compares with last year in Q2 when we saw 22% unit growth.",".

Question: Why is Amazon's fulfillment capacity growing so quickly?
Answer: In Q2, Amazon's fulfillment capacity grew 28% due to strong unit growth and higher fulfillment by Amazon units."
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So we're 600 basis points faster growth in Q2 this year than last year and that 22% last year turned into 26% in Q4. So it ramped up in the back end of the year.
So a lot of data points there, but the bottom line is that there's a large step up in the amount of fulfillment capacity in Q2 - excuse me, Q3 versus Q2. There's a couple of other factors while I'm at it for guidance. We are also nearly doubling our content spend in the second half of this year versus the second half of 2015.",".

Question: What was the increase in fulfillment capacity in Q2?
Answer: The increase in fulfillment capacity in Q2 was due to the addition of new fulfillment centers."
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: We have a great slate of new Amazon Originals coming out later this year, both in the US and internationally, and we're nearly tripling our number of new Amazon Original shows - TV shows and movies compared with the second half of last year. There are other investments, certainly, that are increasing sequentially. I'd point to India and AWS, but primarily the two biggest issues in Q3 guidance I would say are the operational ramp and also the increase in digital content spend.                                         
Darin Manney,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [4]
                                        
And, Mark, to follow up on the other question, our net sales guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates.",".

What is the impact of foreign exchange rates on Amazon's net sales guidance?
The impact of foreign exchange rates on Amazon's net sales guidance is that it anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates."
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call:

And, Brian, where does that bring your video content spend to with the doubling in the second half if we look at it on an annualized basis?                                         
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [6]
                                        
We're not disclosing that at this time.                                         
Mark May,  Citigroup - Analyst    [7]

Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Please state your question.                                         
Douglas Anmuth,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [9]
                                        
Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to go back to Prime Day for a minute. I didn't hear any commentary around new Prime members in particular.",". 

What was the percentage of new Prime members added in the second half of the year?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Obviously a lot of other metrics that you gave but hoping you could provide a little bit more color around that.
And then also, is there anything else that stood out in terms of what you learned around operations and systems ahead of the holiday season? And then just going back to the 3Q guide, what's the right way for us to think about stock-based comp in the third quarter and if we looked at your 2Q numbers, is that a fair assumption for what you're thinking about? Thanks.                                         
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [10]
                                        
Sure. Let me circle back on Prime Day. So again, it was the biggest global day ever for Amazon and was up 60% on a order product sales basis versus Prime Day 2015. It was a record day for Amazon devices.",".

Q: What was the biggest global day ever for Amazon?
A: The biggest global day ever for Amazon was Prime Day."
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: It was a great day for small businesses and sellers who saw great year-over improvement in their sales. And more importantly, it was a great day for customers. Globally they saved over double what they had saved in Prime Day 2015.
So we're very pleased with the results of Prime Day, and the impact of Prime Day is factored into this guidance. As far as new customers and new Prime members, we're not disclosing that, but suffice to say that it was a great day for both existing Prime members and also new customers who were trying us out for the first time.                                         
Darin Manney,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [11]
                                        
And on the stock-based compensation, you'll recall beginning in Q1 this year, we began allocating stock-based compensation and other operating expense to our North America, international and AWS segments.",".

Question: What was the impact of stock-based compensation on Amazon's overall operating expenses?
Answer: The impact of stock-based compensation on Amazon's overall operating expenses was to allocate them to its North America, international and AWS segments."
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So we're including that in our guidance on operating income and have not separately guided to stock-based comp and other income expense this quarter.

Gene Munster,  Piper Jaffray & Co. - Analyst    [13]
                                        
Hello, good afternoon. First, love the conference call format here. Get right to it. In terms of questions, the customer count, can you give us a little bit of guidance on that? And then also talk about the theme of automated consumption and separately, the importance of Prime Now and how you can grow those SKUs. Thanks.

Hi, Gene. This is Darin. I'll start with the customer accounts. As we noted again in our Q1 release, our active customer accounts exceeded 300 million.",".                                    
Gene Munster,  Piper Jaffray & Co. - Analyst    [13]
                                         
Hi Darin. Thanks for taking the call. So, as we noted in our Q1 release, our active customer accounts exceeded 300 million. Can you give us a little bit of guidance on how many new customers we added in the last month? And then secondly, can you talk about the importance of Prime Now and how you're growing that service? Thanks.                                   
Darin Manney,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [14]
                                       
Hi, Gene. This is Darin. I'll start with the customer accounts. So, as we noted in our Q1 release, our active customer accounts exceeded 300 million. We added approximately 1 million new customer accounts in the last month. And then secondly, Prime Now is really important to us. We continue to see strong growth in Prime Now orders, and we're seeing more and more customers ordering through Prime Now on a regular basis. So, that's something that's really important to us, and we're continuing to invest in that service. Thanks."
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: However, today we're not going to update that number.                                         
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [15]
                                        
To your question on Prime Now, so I will point out Prime Now is now in more than 40 metro areas worldwide. In the past quarter we expanded further internationally to Germany, Spain and France, so it's a global program, again, offering free two-hour delivery on tens of thousands of items. We also have in the same vein of, I think what you called maybe automated consumption, the same day has expanded. Now we've added 11 metro areas, bringing the total to 27 metro areas that are qualified for same day.
So, yes, we think this is an important part of our Prime offering. We know customers love it. We're very happy with their order patterns from Prime Now, and very happy with it.",".

1. What is the total number of metro areas that Prime Now is available in?
2. How many items are eligible for free two-hour delivery through Prime Now?
3. What is the name of the program that offers same day delivery to 27 metro areas?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Of course, we do always talk about - we always usually get asked about profitability, and it is a very hard service to deliver and make money on. But we know customers love it and we're in a great position to do this because of our long-term approach, our drive of greater efficiencies and our proximity to the customer with our vast global FC network.

Heath Terry,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [17]
                                        
Great, thanks.",".

What is the company's strategy for increasing profitability?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: I was wondering as it relates to the Q3 guidance, can you give us a bit of a sense of just how we should think about margins in the AWS business, especially as the next eight availability zones roll out? Presumably that kind of increase in capacity likely has an impact on margins, but would appreciate any direction you can share on how to think about that.                                         
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [18]
                                        
Sure. We don't give - obviously we don't give segment-based guidance. But to your question about AWS, we actually see nine availability zones in four regions coming out in the next - in the coming year.",".

Q: How should we think about margins in the AWS business, especially as the next nine availability zones roll out?
A: We don't give - obviously we don't give segment-based guidance. But to your question about AWS, we actually see nine availability zones in four regions coming out in the next - in the coming year."
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: The impact on short-term is pretty much indistinguishable from the growth that we're seeing in our expansion of our base customers in our existing regions, so we don't see a large step-up from the addition of new regions relative to the large and rapid growth in the business itself.
We do think that it does pay benefits both for ourselves and for our customers because of the expansion, and we're happy to have added the region in Mumbai this past quarter. We think when we expand geographically, existing customers will run more of their workloads on AWS. Sometimes they have local latency concerns or security issues that require them to run things in their country, so that helps. And we also open up to new customers when we add these regions.",".

Q: What is the impact on short-term of adding a new region?
A: The impact on short-term is pretty much indistinguishable from the growth that we're seeing in our expansion of our base customers in our existing regions, so we don't see a large step-up from the addition of new regions relative to the large and rapid growth in the business itself."
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So not a large impact on Q3 guidance, but certainly an exciting investment for our customer base.

Thank you. Two questions if I may. As I look at your tech and content expense as a percentage of revenues, we see year-on-year decline for the last two quarters, which is something we hadn't seen since mid-2010, and of course it's reflected in the AWS margins.",". 

What is driving that decline in tech and content expense as a percentage of revenues?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Can you help us understand what has driven this significant change in relative trajectory in tech and content expenses? And the second question is, why is it that the rate at which you are deploying Prime Now is so much greater or faster than the rate at which you are deploying Fresh? What's different between them and how is it that you are deploying Fresh in new markets but not as fast as Prime Now, and what drives the difference? Thank you.                                         
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [21]
                                        
Sure. On tech and content, that's going to be a combination of our people cost related to many areas of the website and also the infrastructure cost to run it, at both the Amazon Web Services and also the Amazon site.",".

On the deployment of Prime Now, we're seeing a lot more demand for it than we anticipated. So we're deploying it faster than we had originally planned. And on Fresh, we're seeing a lot more demand for it in new markets than we anticipated. So we're deploying it faster than we had originally planned as well."
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: We've been seeing some great efficiencies in our infrastructure, both internally as Amazon and also as part of AWS. We have great people working on not only better efficiency, but also driving cost out of our acquisition prices. So, there's a lot of great work going on there and I think that's what you're seeing reflected in the tech and content line. Again, this can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but we're happy with the current trend and you see it in the AWS margins.
On Prime Now versus Fresh, they are separate - sorry. The - we'll point out in Q2 that we added London and Boston as two new sites in London for AmazonFresh, and that was the first international location. But we've been running AmazonFresh for seven years, or excuse me, since 2007 in Seattle.",".

Question: What is the current trend in AWS margins?
Answer: We're happy with the current trend and you see it in the AWS margins."
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: And what you've seen as we've been testing the model, we've been expanding in North America and more so we've been expanding within the cities that we're in, adding zip codes, adding additional customers. So, the move into Boston and also now into London give us some really good data points and as - it's a great customer feature for the Prime offering.
Prime Now is a little bit easier to build up from scratch, I would say. The - it has a different purpose, although some of the products overlap. Again, this is more about immediacy of one-hour and two-hour delivery of a curated list of important products that people need in a short period of time. So, they have different roles.",".

What is the difference between Prime Now and Prime?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Some of the products overlap, of course, but we're happy with both, and we think that customers like both of them.

Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on the Echo. Anything you could share at all on some of the most commonly used searches? How are consumers using the Echo as of now most commonly, and then anything on uplift in purchase behavior from Echo households? And the second one on Prime, on AWS margins, can you just walk us through some of the puts and takes that have been driving the AWS margin expansion we've seen in the first half of this year? Is it utilization, product mixes? What's been driving the margin expansion? Thanks.",".

Sure. Well, in Echo, again, we continue to build out the list of devices, launching the Dot and Tap and Fire TV skills this past year. And now we have 1,900 third-party skills for the Alexa, including new skills from Kayak, Lyft, NBC, Honeywell and more. So there's a lot of uses that we're seeing for Echo. A lot ties into our Prime Music offering. It's just a great way to access Prime Music and more and more the Amazon site. We don't have anything to disclose on physical orders from - through - excuse me, orders through Echo.
On Amazon Web Services margin, again, this is primarily due to efficiencies gained on our infrastructure, better utilization, better cost out. There is a - certainly a mix of products and services.",".

What is the mix of products and services that contributes to Amazon Web Services margin?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: I don't have a bridge for you on whether that's helpful or hurtful, but the - these margins in AWS will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, and that's what you're seeing.

Okay. Brian, could you give us some whys as to the revenue growth acceleration that you're seeing, a little more color about the revenue growth acceleration in North American retail and in international retail? I remember last quarter you called out really starting to see, I don't know, critical mass, tipping point, whatever the buzzword is, from Prime and from FBA in international markets.",".

Brian J. Olsavsky, Chief Financial Officer - Amazon.com Inc.: Sure. So we're seeing really strong growth in Prime and in FBA internationally. We think that there's a lot of potential for continued growth in these areas. And I think it's important to note that these are still early days for both Prime and FBA.

Sure. Yes, I have the same buzzwords for you, Mark. It's really   the flywheel of Prime is definitely working. It's as simple as that. The low prices, vast selection and convenience continue to resonate with customers. Prime membership increases and selection through FBA makes Prime more valuable. So it's a bit as simple as that in the consumer business in North America and international, we are seeing great acceptance of Prime and usage of Prime benefits.",".

What is the flywheel of Prime?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: We continue to expand the list of Prime benefits for customers to make it more valuable, and none is more valuable than FBA, which we've talked a lot about the value of Prime to FBA and vice-versa.
FBA is bringing more Prime-eligible selection to Prime and then the growth of Prime and the type of customers that utilize Prime and their buying behavior is a great traction for other FBA sellers. So that is essentially what we're seeing, and we're certainly pleased with the customer response to those offers globally.

Why wouldn't we assume that maybe, at least on the margin, the investment intensity in the business has maybe decelerated a bit?
And second, on Prime Video, just was wondering, considering what the main competitor there is doing, i.e., expanding aggressively around the world, you guys have been growing in a more measured manner, is that still the plan or are you guys interested in maybe instead of moving into a few countries, expand globally in one fell swoop?

What is Amazon's plan for expanding into more countries?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So on Prime Video, again, we're very happy with the customer adoption of Prime Video, and we know the customers love it. We like the results that we see, particularly with the free trial conversion, the renewal rates for subscriptions. So it's clearly working. I mentioned earlier how we're doubling the investment rate in the second half of the year versus last year's second half, and we're tripling the Amazon Originals content.
That Originals content for TV and movies, that content can be used globally. We've talked a bit about our Prime launch in India, and alluded to the fact that we'll be having video soon in India, but local content and also Amazon Originals. So, stay tuned for that. I don't have any more to announce on that today.",".

Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: On the variance to guidance, what I'll say is, we came in the very high end of our revenue guidance. I would say that our business model usually reacts well to high volume as we get a really good leverage on our fixed expenses. So that's part of what we saw, very strong operating efficiencies as we hit essentially the highest end of our revenue guidance.
But we do have a lot of diverse profit streams here at Amazon and a lot of investments going on at any point in time. I think I heard a question there about level of investment. We continue to invest heavily. In fact, I just called out a few things that are going to be stepping up in investment levels in Q3, mostly ops and digital content.",".

Sure. Well, first of all, we believe customers will choose AWS primarily for three factors, the functionality and pace of innovation that we bring to the table, our partner and customer ecosystem and our experience. We've been in this business longer than anyone. Having said that, there's plenty of room for multiple winners in this business.",".

You can see us continue to invest in things like new application services, higher up the stack, additional technologies that will make integrating with AWS seamless for those companies that have a hybrid IT environment and then continuing to add functionality for data analytics, mobile, Internet of things, machine learning offerings, things like that, that will add greater and greater value for AWS customers.

That's a faster pace than last year when we added 722 services and features.",".

Okay. Thanks, guys. As another follow up on the margins, I was hoping you could comment on any impact from the investments and build out of enhanced transportation capabilities including the air cargo leases.

Q: What impact has the investment in transportation capabilities, including the air cargo leases, had on margins?
A: We don't have any specific numbers to share at this time."
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: First, on EGM, I'll just say the growth is across a lot of different products, none to exactly call out here, and we think that a lot of it is, of course, driven by the growth of Prime itself. EGM in North America grew 32%, which was higher than the revenue growth rate, and also grew 36% internationally. So when people join Prime, they are certainly buying EGM in strong quantity. So that continues to grow with the growth of the Prime program.
On transportation, I think your question was about whether that's impacting our short-term results. No, the answer is no. We are certainly expanding our service offerings in the transportation side and we have been for many years, things like sortation centers and delivery methods.","

On the short-term results, I think it's important to remember that we have been growing at a much faster clip than our revenue. So our margin expansion has been more about getting closer to our revenue growth rate than it has been about expanding our margin.
On the long-term outlook, I think it's really hard to predict what the future will hold. But I think we are very bullish about the opportunities that exist for Amazon.com."

The cost of building centers is scaling over time given the use of Kiva, other technologies or general learnings. And also, we noticed some device sellout in the next four to five weeks, post-Prime Day."
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Was this a bit of a planned inventory reduction for some of the devices or did volumes take you by surprise here?                                         
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [39]
                                        
I will start with the second question. So I would just say Prime Day had enormous impact on the device business and devices were well featured and also well adopted by customers. So it was the largest device sales day that we've ever had and essentially pretty much across all of our device types, E-readers, tablets, Fire TV and Echo.
And I'm sorry, your first question was around - the cost of fulfillment centers. Not disclosing that we do continue to change our fulfillment centers. We've changed, again, the automation, the size, the scale many times and we continue to learn and grow there.",".

The answer is that Prime Day had a significant impact on the device business and volumes were well above our expectations."
Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So no general trends I can point to on cost per fulfillment center to start up, but because they do vary in size and mission and some have fully outfitted in using Amazon Robotics, others - some don't for economic reasons. Maybe the volume is not perfect for robot volume. But, yes, so I can't give you any real distinct trends there.

I was wondering, what are you seeing in that market that justifies that level of investment?                                         
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [54]
                                        
Sure. So India, we're very encouraged by what we've seen so far in India, both with customers and also sellers; that's a third-party seller market. You heard that we launched the Prime program this week, which will be a whole new experience for Indian customers. In hundreds of cities we'll now have unlimited free one-day and two-day delivery, and we also mentioned that Prime Video is coming there, both Indian and global content.
We're also starting to see exclusive online sales partnerships.",".

But more importantly, again, we really like the opportunity in India. We like the initial results that we see from customers and also sellers. We really like our team there. We have a great team of Amazonians who've been very inventive in India.
Every time there's an obstacle or something that's different from the US or another major business, they'll invent around it, whether it's a shipping method or a payment method or whatever. So, very creative and the customer response has been really strong. So we are very excited about the Prime program. We think it'll enter into a new chapter in India, and we've seen great success in every country in the world that we've launched Prime, and we feel India is going to be no different.","

What is the team's reaction to the success of the Prime program in India?"

And hi, Victor, this is Darin. On Italy, yes, we continue to invest in Italy and really throughout Europe to keep pace with the strong customer demand we see. Since opening Italy in 2010, we've invested over EUR450 million and created 1,700 jobs in Italy, and this increased investment will be to add future FC near Rome and other infrastructure assets.

Thanks for taking the question. The international retail segment margin was the lowest we have seen in quite a while. I was hoping that you could provide some of the key drivers there in terms of the drag and any color on how to think about the incremental international investment that might be impacting the 4Q guide. Thanks.                                         
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [3]
                                        
Sure. Thanks, Doug. Specifically to international, we are seeing expansion to support selection expansion fulfillment network increases. We're also investing in digital content and additional prime benefits, Fresh location and Prime Now. By far the biggest individual thing is the investment in India that we continue to make. Very excited about the initial reaction in India from both customers and also sellers.",. 1.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.                                         
Gene Munster,  Piper Jaffray & Co. - Analyst    [6]
                                        
Great. Thanks. I guess when we think about the progression in margins in the second half versus the second half of 2015 and kind of the flat lining of overall margin at this point, excluding AWS, should we think about this as a temporary plateau that will at some point will resume once you start leveraging your fulfillment build-out or is there something structural that is philosophically changing with the way that you operate your business. Thanks.                                         
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [7]
                                        
Yes. Thanks, Gene.",".


What is Amazon's philosophy behind margins?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: We will continue to invest in the business where we are seeing significant customer traction. The things that I'm about to mention fall into that category. The largest individual reasons for the ramp-up in investment between the first half and second half of this year and also second half of this year versus second half of last year are the things that I mentioned on the call last quarter.
First, video content and marketing associated with that is nearly doubling year over year in the second half of the year. It continues to be a large increase for both Q3 and Q4. In the quarter in Q3, we added 18 fulfillment centers and we have added 5 more in October. For the year, we will add 26.",".

Question: What is the largest individual reason for the ramp-up in investment between the first half and second half of this year and also second half of this year versus second half of last year?
Answer: The largest individual reason for the ramp-up in investment between the first half and second half of this year and also second half of this year versus second half of last year is the increase in video content and marketing associated with that."
Edited version Q3 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Most of those are in North America.
That compares to 14 last year and I would   looking back, there is   the last time we had double-digit increase in fulfillment centers was 2012 when we added 11 in the third quarter. There was a rare aggregation of startups in Q3 and into Q4. It is helping us position better for Q4 volumes, because paid unit growth continues to be strong and Amazon fulfilled unit growth, which includes what we ship, includes FBA is significantly higher than even that. We are continuing to build for high AFN, or Amazon fulfilled network demand, including both retail and FBA.
The number of warehouses that we added represent the 30% increase in square footage year over year. Last year we increased square footage by just under 20%.",".

What is the number of warehouses that Amazon added in Q3 2016?
The number of warehouses that Amazon added in Q3 2016 was 30%."
Edited version Q3 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: The definition of square footage in this case is all of our warehouses, plus our sortation and delivery centers, so it's pretty much our end-customer service centers. It's pretty much our square footage that support operations.
Those will dissipate as we   as they burn in. We've talked about fulfillment centers initial startup costs include increase in fixed cost but also variable cost as we train workers and also bring in inventory. There's a number of transportation costs also related to the startup of a new fulfillment center, both inbound and outbound. They are inherently less efficient than more established, mature buildings.",".

What are the transportation costs related to the startup of a new fulfillment center?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: There will be a cycle where those will be more productive next year than they are this year and more productive in 2018 than they are in 2017.
What you are seeing, essentially, in the second half of this year is a step-up investment, primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center investment, but also things like Echo and Alexa which we're adding a lot of resources to, India and AWS as we add people there to support additional service rapid growth in that business.                                         
Operator    [8]
                                        
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.                                         
Brian Nowak,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [9]
                                        
Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one, just to go back, Brian, to the fulfillment build.",". What is the primary driver behind the increase in fulfillment capacity?                                         
The primary driver behind the increase in fulfillment capacity is the increase in digital content and the fulfillment center investment."
Edited version Q3 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: In the past you talked about how it takes time to kind of get the fulfillment centers to peak efficiencies. With these new FCs opening, can you talk about if you become more efficient, so if you get into a lower volume quarter next year, there's less risk of deleverage or should we still think about it's going to take time to get up to peak efficiency?
The second one at AWS, Amazon the Company is good in removing friction in the purchase process. Can you talk about some of the main hurdles you have to overcome for large enterprises to start using AWS more? Thanks.                                         
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [10]
                                        
Sure. In the fulfillment network, as we build it yes, they will be more productive next year than this holiday peak and probably even more productive in 2018.",".

Question: What is the peak efficiency of the fulfillment centers?
Answer: The peak efficiency of the fulfillment centers is currently increasing."
Edited version Q3 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: I can't forecast it for you into next year quite yet, but we certainly had productivity and additional costs in Q3 and even into Q4 of this year as we built the additional capacity. Again, the underlying reason for that capacity build is the strength in paid units and even more so in the units that we're fulfilling, driven by our FBA program.
The FBA program is the key pillar of our Prime offering. It adds selection. It makes Prime stronger. That's a self-reinforcing loop where Prime   the Prime success attracts more sellers. We're glad to have that problem. We are just working very hard to get capacity in place and productive use for Q4 and beyond.                                         
Darin Manney,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [11]
                                        
Hi, Brian. This is Darin.",".

What is the key pillar of Amazon.com's Prime offering?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: On the AWS question, we continue to invest in AWS on behalf of our customers. In addition to the technologies that make integrations easier and it helps companies move from an on-prem or a hybrid IT environment into AWS if we're going to continue to do that. Specifically, the database migration tool that are helpful for customers when they move production databases from on premises to the cloud with virtually no downtime.
Also, many of our AWS customers are beginning to choose and continue to choose the AWS schema conversion tool which really switches database engines to get out of old-guard proprietary databases and on to AWS. We will continue to react to customer needs and that will include opening up new regions. We have opened up Ohio this past quarter.",".

What is the AWS schema conversion tool?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: We've highlighted that we will have a number of regions coming online in a few months. Yes, we're doing a lot of things to help make it easier for all customers to migrate to AWS.

Mark Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [13]
                                        
Okay. Hey, Brian, would you give us any commentary on two categories in particular, groceries and fashion and apparel? Particularly on groceries, I know in the release there was a couple of data points about Fresh rolling out into newer areas like Maryland. Great to see that.",".

Similarly, but not exactly the same, is the Prime Now business which has similar overlap on things besides groceries.

We're very happy with the Amazon Fresh and we have now expanded quite a bit as you see in this year. Prime Now we're also very happy with, although obviously the economics in that business are even tougher, but we do feel that our scale makes that possible because of our geographic footprint and how close we already are to customers.

Yes. On wages, nothing to point out for this holiday. Our challenge generally is the volume of head count that we're looking to hire. We work well in advance with agencies to help to get seasonal employees and many of them turn into full-time employees after the holiday.",".

Yes, we are seeing wage pressure in the fulfillment centers."
Edited version Q3 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Nothing specific on the wage pressure front. As you probably saw, head count is up 38% year over year in Q3 and that is continuation of a lot of ops roles that are supporting this high demand, the opening the fulfillment centers we talked about, new Fresh locations, Prime Now, but also and a lot of hiring in our tech areas, strictly around AWS and also the Echo/Alexa areas.

Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO    [44]
                                        
Yes, sure. We are very encouraged by what we're seeing in India, but it is certainly very early on still. Most recent highlights would be the launch of the Prime program in India this past quarter. It's now one of the top-selling units on Amazon.India. It has been well received by customers.
It is hard to compare India to any other country. It is very different in its stage and structure. Being a third-party market has caused a lot of invention on our side. We're being creative.",":

What was the percentage growth in paid units?"

Q1. What is the company's total revenue for Q1 2017?
A. Amazon.com, Inc. reported total revenue of $30.5 billion for Q1 2017."
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 27, 2017, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures."," for each of the following non-GAAP financial measures:

1. GAAP net income
2. GAAP diluted earnings per share
3. GAAP operating income
4. GAAP net cash provided by operating activities
5. Free cash flow

Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world event; the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements.","

What is Amazon.com Inc's guidance for the fourth quarter and full year?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
Before moving to Q&A, I would like to draw attention to a new accounting rule that we implemented in Q1. The new rule requires excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation to be presented as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows. We retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to reclassify excess tax benefits from financing activities to operating activities. And as a result, you will see an increase in our free cash flow measures for prior periods.
Additionally, beginning January 1, 2017, the excess tax benefit or deficiency for stock-based compensation is recognized as a component of tax expense rather than equity.",".

Question: What is the new accounting rule that was implemented in Q1?
Answer: The new rule requires excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation to be presented as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows."
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: This change resulted in a decrease to our tax expense for the quarter and a corresponding increase to our net income and earnings per share. Specific changes are presented in the footnotes to the consolidated statement of cash flows and related metrics provided in our press release. Further disclosure of the impact of the adoption of this accounting change can be found in our Form 10-Q.
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question. 
                                        
Questions and Answers
                                        
Operator    [1]
                                                   (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.                                         
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [2]
                                                   Got it. Saw on the front pages of release you're really focused on India."," that would address that.                                      

Justin Post: So, can you give us a little more color on the growth in India? What's driving that? And what are some of the challenges you're seeing there?

Jeff Bezos: So, India is really growing rapidly. We think it's going to be one of the biggest markets over the next few years. There are a lot of reasons for that. One is that the population is growing very quickly. Another is that the country is getting more and more affluent. And lastly, we think there's a lot of potential for e-commerce there.

There are some challenges, though. One is that the infrastructure is still not as developed as it could be. And another is that there are some regulatory issues that we're still working through. But we're optimistic about the future there."
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Can you give us a progress update on how you're doing? Any thoughts on how far you're willing to take the investment levels there? And what are your thoughts on maybe when international margins can start to make progress?                                         
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [3]
                                                   Sure, Justin. Thank you. Yes, I think Jeff's comments were pretty dead on. The launch of Prime last year was a big turning point. We've increased Prime selection by 75% since launching that 9 months ago in India, also increased the fulfillment capacity for sellers by 26% this year. On the content side, we've announced 18 Indian Original TV series, and we're customizing the content. So it's a really vast selection of local and global movies and TV shows that are available to the Indian public.",. Question: What are your thoughts on when international margins can start to make progress? Answer: We think that international margins will continue to make progress as we continue to invest in our business and grow the selection of products and services that we offer.
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: You'll also notice that the Fire TV Stick was   the new version of it was launched in India with some important features there, such as the ability to search in Hindi and in English, free data usage for 3 months and also data monitoring, which is important there. So we're   again, we continue to be encouraged by both the response from customers and sellers. As far as level of investment is concerned, it is certainly one of our important investment areas. We see a lot of potential for the country and our business there.                                         
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [4]
                                                   Any thoughts on how much this is impacting your international profitability?                                         
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [5]
                                                   Sure.",".

What is the impact of the increase in international profitability on Amazon.com's overall profitability? The increase in international profitability is likely to have a positive impact on Amazon.com's overall profitability."
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: I can't quantify it, but   or break out specifically, but I will say it's a large factor as well as a couple other things in the international segment. So keep in mind that we launched Prime Video in the fourth quarter, and now we have that in over 200 countries and territories. We're spreading a lot of the Prime benefits that we've seen in North America to other countries. We just opened up AmazonFresh in Tokyo last weekend, but also Prime Now. You saw other things like our business   B2B business just opened up in the U.K. We have Amazon devices. So there's a lot of moving parts here.","

What factors are contributing to Amazon's growth in international markets?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: The other big influence is the same trends are happening in international with respect to FBA growth and the fact that our Amazon fulfilled network or the units we shipped are growing at much faster clip than our paid unit growth. Last year, we said that was a 40%   nearly 40% growth worldwide, so we're making the investments in warehouses, fulfillment capacity and delivery capacity to handle that. So there's a lot going on in international. We are very encouraged with the growth of the Prime program, and we're hopeful for the Prime Video that we launched in the fall.

Mark S. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [7]
                                                   Okay. 2 questions.",".

What is the Prime program's growth rate?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: The North American operating margins seem to come down like 70 bps year-over-year, and I know it's not a big focus of you, the margins. I get that, but it's sort of a change. You've had margins be flat or up year-over-year for quite some time and now they dip down.","

What is the reason for the 70 bps year-over-year decrease in North American operating margins?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Just could you explain that? And then secondly, on these   on the Echo devices, the Echo family, Alexa devices that are coming out, could you comment at all about what kind of impact you're seeing in terms of increased wallet or per share within household? Are you seeing that have an impact in terms of Amazon customers more likely to spend more once they have these devices in particular categories like groceries or household products, Pantry, products that they're more likely to spend because they have these devices in their houses, in their kitchens, in their living rooms?                                         
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [8]
                                                   Sure, Mark. Let me start with the Echo question first. So yes, we're very encouraged by the customer response to the Echo products.",".

Q: What is the customer response to the Echo products?
A: We're very encouraged by the customer response to the Echo products."
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Not only the Echo products, but the ability to use tablets   our tablets now as Echo devices since we've spread the Alexa technology to many of those devices. And we're also happy with the success we've had with developers. There's over now over 12,000 Alexa skills. So we think that's all foundational. The monetization, as you might call it, is   the theme of your questions, that's not our primary issue right now. It's about building great products and delighting customers. We think as engagement   as we pick up engagement with the devices, it helps the engagement with Amazon as a whole. So whether someone is ordering off their Alexa device or whether they're going to their phone or going to their computer, it all has the same effect for us. So very, very pleased with the initial progress.",".

Q: What is the primary issue you are seeing with monetization at this point?

A: We're very pleased with the initial progress of building great products and delighting customers."
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: We see a lot of momentum there, and we continue to invest. And that's one of the answers to your second question on North America operating margin. So if I step back, let me just talk generally about investment. So right now we're just seeing a lot of great opportunities before us, and we're continuing to ramp up the investments in pursuit of those opportunities. And the big picture is, again, as we've said, customers   we want the things that customers love, can grow to be large, will have strong financial returns and they're durable and can last for decades. So in that category and some of the things that we are investing the most in are, as you say, the Echo and Alexa devices. We're doubling down on that investment, video content and marketing, not only in the U.S.","

1. What are some of the investments Amazon is making in order to pursue opportunities?
2. How does Amazon plan to generate long-term financial returns for its customers?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: but globally with the launch of our Prime Video in the fall. So we're building global scale in that business in both content and marketing. As I said earlier, we're expanding Prime benefits in the U.S. and also globally, things like Prime Music, Prime Now, AmazonFresh, all expanding globally. And we've launched Prime in India, China and Mexico. I know I'm drifting a bit from North America, but it's all part of the same theme. We also have this trend going on in our fulfillment networks where strong FBA growth and high growth in Amazon fulfilled units is resulting in a large increase in fulfillment capacity. We're also investing in new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning. You're starting to see some of that show up in things like Amazon Go, our beta store that we've developed in Seattle; drones.",".

Question: What is the trend in Amazon fulfilled units?

Answer: The trend in Amazon fulfilled units is a large increase in fulfillment capacity."
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: We use those technologies a lot in our internal businesses, and we're also developing services for AWS customers. So   and that's   of course, another area as AWS continues to grow and add services and features and doing so at an accelerating rate. So there's a long list and I can keep going, but I think the general theme is we're   there's a lot of investment in front of us that we're optimistic about and we continue to ramp those investments. In North America, that manifests itself mostly in the device area, the content area and also the expansion of the fulfillment networks.

                                                   I have 2. Just the first one, Amazon always has a pretty big focus on efficiency."," that you think investors might be interested in.                                      

What are Amazon's plans to continue to increase efficiency within its operations?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So I'd be curious to talk   if you could talk about examples or areas where you've been able to iron out inefficiencies in the fulfillment process. And there's   any still existing examples where you see low-hanging fruit to really improve fulfillment efficiency? And then just back to the point on investment, you didn't mention brick-and-mortar at all, yet there's been a lot of mention in the press about Amazon brick-and-mortar. I guess I'd be curious to hear how you think about the importance of an Amazon brick-and-mortar presence and how that fits into the long-term strategy.

2. How important to you is an Amazon brick-and-mortar presence?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: That technology continues to improve, and we've   we're now multiple generations down. We just launched a Amazon robotics fulfillment center in the Tokyo area recently. And so toward that last month, and it's just amazing to see the strides that the Amazon robotics has taken and the efficiency we're getting in our warehouse as a result. The other efficiencies we're seeing are network efficiencies, especially as we had things like sort centers. It's a collaboration and a movement between warehouses and sort centers and then to the end customer. The ability to have control through our sort centers has allowed us over the last few years to cut off our   to extend our cut off times from 3 p.m., in most cases, till midnight. So greater control of our processes.",".

So there's a lot of efficiencies that are going on day-to-day around here. One of the benefits of rapid growth and   is the ability to create leverage on purchases and a lot of the processes that we run. So your second question was on stores. Yes, yes, I think you're seeing the expansion of our bookstores. We have 6 bookstores right now, and we've announced another 6. The Amazon Go is in beta in Seattle. And while that's not large and it's only one site, we're excited about the potential there and the use of the technologies of computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning.

Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Yes, CapEx, which is principally the fulfillment centers, was   grew 51% year-over-year. As you'll remember, we added 26 warehouses last   fulfillment centers last year, 23 in the second half of the year. Some of that cost of startup is before the startup. Some comes in a quarter afterwards. So there was some carryover from that. But generally, the biggest trend here is that the difference   differential between Amazon fulfilled network unit growth and paid unit growth. So that nearly 40% growth in Amazon fulfilled units last year and the continuation of the strong growth higher than the paid unit growth that we see in 2017 is resulting in a lot of fulfillment center capacity.",".

Question: What was the primary driver of growth in CapEx last year?

Answer: The primary driver of growth in CapEx last year was the addition of 26 warehouses last year, 23 of which were added in the second half of the year."
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: And the fulfillment centers, I will also say, with the robotics technology tend to be more capital intensive than prior versions of warehouses and then they're   generally have much better operating efficiencies and variable costs following their start up. On the capital leases, as grew 45%. A good deal of that is tied to the AWS business. As I just mentioned, a lot of that's tied to unit   excuse me   usage growth. But I'll caution, CapEx can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. And if you look back to last year, the trailing 12 months was only 7% growth from the quarters through Q1 of last year. So certainly, there was a bigger step up in 2016, now carrying into 2017.

                                                   Sure. Let me start with advertising. So yes, I think scale is helping. We have great teams working on advertising for a while now. Our scale in number of customers, number of clicks, number of eyeballs and new content   or excuse me, video content and other opportunities for advertising has really helped create some scale in that business. So we're very happy. I can't project it forward, but we're happy with the growth there. I think the Sponsored Products was a very inventive move for us, and I think that is having some really good impact on advertising growth.",".

What impact do you think Sponsored Products has had on advertising growth?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: On your second point about fulfillment capacity, here's how I'd generally   I'd generalize it. We   in Q4 of 2015, we were pretty vocal, or pretty transparent anyway, that we ran out of space in Q4, especially due to some very strong demand for FBA space and services. Last year, we changed some of our incentives to   and worked with FBA merchants to try and have their throughput to our FCs, particularly in Q4. That, combined with the step up in fulfillment centers that I mentioned, the 26 new ones, left us in a really good position. We had a very clean holiday, and we think it worked well for both customers, Amazon and also for sellers, especially for FBA sellers.","

Question: What incentives did Amazon change in order to try and manage throughput to fulfillment centers in Q4 of 2016?

Answer: In order to manage throughput to fulfillment centers, Amazon changed some of its incentives, including increasing the fee for FBA sellers to use Amazon's fulfillment centers."
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So yes, that leaves us now continuing to grow internationally as well because we continue to see strong FBA adoption, and it's a big part of our business, and it's a big part of our value with the additional Prime eligible ASINs that FBA provides. So again, it's   they're self-reinforcing, the FBA program and also our Prime program. Prime program attracts more people to Amazon, and they buy more, including FBA products. And conversely, more FBA products in our warehouses helps our in stock of things that people want to buy, Prime eligible in stock, and that helps reinforce the Prime program.

Question: What is the primary driver of the increase in deferred revenue balances?

Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: We're not breaking out the specific growth rates for Prime. But certainly, we like what we see in terms of the growth, and it's been consistent with what we've seen over the last quarter or so. Certainly, part of that increase in deferred balances is related to Reserved Instances as customers get more comfortable and begin to put more sustained workloads into the AWS services. Through buying RIs, they're able to get fairly significant discounts on their usage. And so we like that model, customers certainly like that model and collecting that through deferred revenue and then letting customers use that over time is very helpful.

So it   our approach varies by country. If you look historically, we've taken multiple approaches. So in China, we bought an existing business, Joyo.com, and built off that base. In India, we started from scratch and have built a lot of things ourselves.",".

Q: What was the approach in China?
A: We bought an existing business, Joyo.com."
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: And it's always going to depend on the country, the dynamics in that country both for retail, for online and for foreign investment. But a real key factor in all of this generally is management bandwidth as well. So we pick our spots carefully. You'll see   you heard in the quarter that we've announced the intention to buy Souq in the Middle East. Where does that fit into the strategy? Well, Souq is a pioneered e-commerce in the Middle East, and they're creating great shipping experience for the customers and their multiple countries and they're doing a great job. So we see this as an example where we can learn from them and also support their efforts with our Amazon technology and global resources. So we   we are in Mexico, but we're not in other parts of Latin America.",".

Question: What is management bandwidth?
Answer: Management bandwidth is the ability of a company to make quick decisions and move quickly in order to compete in the marketplace."
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: We're   we have a business in Brazil, but other countries will take on a case-by-case basis, again, bounded by what our management bandwidth can support and prioritization versus other things. You obviously heard my long list of investments. All of those are pretty much gated by the need for people and software engineers and strong teams to approach them. So international expansion gets played off in the same prioritization that other efforts do.                                         
Operator    [36]
                                                   Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Co.                                         
Jason Stuart Helfstein,  Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Internet Analyst    [37]
                                                   So is there   just an accounting housekeeping, a way to think about stock-based comp. You guys aren't providing that by segment anymore, but the rates of growth kind of differed by the businesses.",".

An answer from above paragraph:

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as stock-based compensation rates vary depending on the business."
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: And so is there just a way to think about, a, will that be in the Q, or are you not disclosing anymore? And is there a way to think about would, I guess, the patterns be consistent with historical patterns by segment?                                         
Darin Manney,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Head of IR    [38]
                                                   Jason, this is Darin. We, a number of quarters back, started breaking out stock-based compensation by segment, and now we've collapsed that in our op income by segment. So it's definitely in there. We do provide some disclosure by P&L line item on a consolidated basis that helps you identify that stock-based compensation expense in total, and you'll see the trend analysis in the metrics at the back of the press release.                                         
Operator    [39]
                                                   Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS.",".

Eric Sheridan, UBS - Analyst   

Jason, can you talk about the trend analysis in terms of stock-based compensation expense by segment?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call:                                         
Eric James Sheridan,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst    [40]
                                                   Maybe I could take 2 away from the press release just to understand a little bit of the quarter-over-quarter cadence. The retail subscription services, that's a pretty big jump up in the growth rate year-on-year in Q1 versus Q4. I think that might be Prime memberships had come on to paid from trial, but just want to understand what maybe what some of the driver was of that quarter-over-quarter in terms of the growth rate. And net shipping costs actually grew at the slowest rate by our count in a couple years. It looks like you're starting to get some improvements there in terms of revenue over costs on the shipping line.",".

What was the driver of the growth rate in Q1 for Amazon's retail subscription services?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: I just wanted to know what that was in terms of what's driving that, and can we expect that to possibly continue.                                         
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [41]
                                                   Sure. Let me start with the retail subscription services revenue. So there's multiple things in that category, the largest is Prime membership fees, but also other subscription services like audiobooks, e-books, digital video, digital music and other subscription services. So you're right, there was an acceleration. Much like the comment I had on advertising and the other revenue category, the Prime membership growth rates for Q1 and Q4 last year are relatively consistent. So the volatility is in those other items. So I'm not quantifying the Prime membership or commenting on the growth rates other than to say it's been very strong and Q4 strength has continued into Q1.",".

What is driving the strong growth in subscription services revenue?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Your comment on shipping costs, yes, that is going to   that was a lower unit volume as well. But generally, costs are going to be a combination of the tailwind   the headwinds obviously are going to be FBA growth and shipping more products ourselves and this expansion of our Prime program and the demand for products from our Prime customers. And demand's been great. Again, there's over 50 million items that people can get delivered to their doorstep within 2 days or, in some cases, next day or same day. So it's going to be a big part of our cost structure, but it's an investment we work hard to reduce as far as rates and we're glad to spend it to support our Prime program.                                         
Operator    [42]
                                                   And our final question will come from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.",".

The company's long-term goal is to continue to grow the Prime membership program."

                                                   I have a follow-up and then a new question. The follow-up is would love an update. You talked about the fulfillment centers, but could you update us on where we are in terms of rolling out Prime Now facilities and sorting centers   just a count? And if you feel that's an area to really ramp-up investment this year, or what you got last year is sort of what you need.                                         
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [44]
                                                   Sure. I'm sorry, you said Prime Now. And what was the other thing?                                         
Gregory Scott Melich,  Evercore ISI, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Consumer Research Team and Senior Equity Research Analyst    [45]

Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [46]
                                                   Sort centers, right. Well, I don't have updated numbers for you, but the Prime Now is available in more than 45 cities across 8 countries. The same day is available in 30 cities in the U.S. So that's a bit on the quantification of those. I can't tell you much more on sort centers.                                         
Gregory Scott Melich,  Evercore ISI, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Consumer Research Team and Senior Equity Research Analyst    [47]
                                                   But when you think about building out the capacity, it sounds like last year you had that big surge in fulfillment centers. There isn't a similar surge about to happen this year on some of those other areas?

What is the number of fulfillment centers Amazon plans to build this year?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: We're still growing that, and we're happy with the progress in Prime Now and the service that   the value it creates for Prime customers. And as I said, we've expanded internationally, which is a big goal of ours as well. So we will continue to grow that. I can't quantify it for you right now. The other similar-like facility metric you might want is AmazonFresh is now in 21 metro areas in the U.S. as well as London and Tokyo.

As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2015.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 2, 2017 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially.",".
What is Amazon's guidance for the fourth quarter of 2016?

We are providing guidance for net sales of $30.5 billion and operating income of $3.5 billion. We expect these results to be within a range of $30.0 billion to $31.5 billion."
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we have seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable, and may be materially affected by many factors.","

What are the factors that could potentially impact Amazon.com's financial results?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It is not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
And just briefly before we move to questions, I would like to address our Form 10-K that we will be filing with the SEC.",".

What factors do you believe could cause your guidance to differ from actual results?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: We received a comment letter from the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance regarding our 2015 Form 10-K, and have subsequently been engaged with the SEC staff regarding our disclosures.
We will be revising the disclosures of net, product and service sales in our Form 10-K. As a result, we expect to file our 2016 Form 10-K later than we typically have, but before the SEC's due date of March 1. These changes relate to our entity-wide disclosures and do not impact the financial results that we report for the Company or our segments.
With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.

Question: What are the changes to net, product and service sales disclosures in the Form 10-K?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So the first quarter GAAP operating income guide essentially implies negative incremental margins at the low, mid and high end of guidance. So just wondering if you can frame in order of possible the investment areas that are driving the negative incremental margins, and then just generally how should we think about the margin profile in 2017? Thank you.                                         
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com Inc. - CFO    [3]
                                                   Thank you, John. First, let me talk about revenue just to get that out there as well.
We are guiding to 17% to 25% growth on an FX-neutral basis. That includes approximately   on top of that is approximately 250 basis points or $730 million of FX negative impact, which brings the non-FX adjusted range down to 14% to 23%.
I will also point out we that had the Leap Year comp from last year.",".

Question: What is the FX-neutral growth guidance?
Answer: The FX-neutral growth guidance is 17% to 25%."
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Last year, the extra day of Leap Year was worth 150 basis points to us in our Q1 revenue. This year that reverses, so we have 150 basis point headwind to growth and it's been factored into our guidance range.
But your question was on bottom line. So yes, what you are seeing, John, is the continuation of the step-up investment that we saw in the second half of last year. I talked about in prior calls about the fulfillment center step up.
We had 26 warehouses we added last year, 23 of them were in the second half of the year. Digital content, digital video content, end marketing stepped up quite a bit in the second half of the year.
We continue to invest heavily in those two areas.",".

Question: What was the total investment in fulfillment centers last year?
Answer: The total investment in fulfillment centers last year was $2.4 billion."
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: We also have investments in other Prime benefits from Prime Now to Amazon Fresh, and of course we're continuing to invest in Alexa in our Echo devices.

                                                   Hello, thank you. The question is on video. I was wondering if you could just give any quantification in terms of the magnitude of video spend in 2017, as well as the lumpiness from an expensing standpoint quarterly?
And then separately as it relates to just the video service.",".

Thank you. We did $2.5 billion in video spend last year and it was pretty evenly split between streaming and downloads. So it's a pretty significant category for us. And as you mentioned, it's pretty evenly split between streaming and downloads so it's not really lumpy from an expensing standpoint."

Is it the uniqueness of the content or is it other things? If you could provide a little bit of color on that, that would be helpful. Thank you.

                                                   Well ultimately, I will step back and say one of the main things we look at on Prime Video is customer usage patterns. And in 2016, we had a doubling of Prime hours for video, music and reading.",".

What is the doubling of Prime hours for video, music and reading? 
The doubling of Prime hours means that Prime members are using Prime more than ever before."
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So we are happy with the engagement that customers have.
We're also happy with the   especially on the studio side, the people we have been able to work with. Some of the most talented people in the entertainment industry. And our customers have responded really well to the shows that we have created. We have garnered awards of course, but mainly what we were focused on is good content that is attractive to customers.
I will also point out that we rolled out the global Prime Video offer in the second half of last   in Q4, and what we see there is again original content is a fixed cost expense. The more we can amortize it over a large base, the better off we will be.",".

Question: What is the global Prime Video offer?
Answer: The global Prime Video offer is a subscription service that offers customers access to a library of movies and TV shows."
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: But more importantly, we have great content that we want to share with people outside of our primary retail countries and this takes us to over 200 more countries.
So we are very happy with the results in video. Yes, the investment did step up in the second half of last year, including marketing and that will continue in 2017 and likely beyond.

The offering in China that we have for consumers is also a great trusted customer engagement. We have a very strong and trusted venue for Chinese customers to access international brands there, as we continue to focus on great offerings through the Amazon global store which offers great brands from outside of China to customers. And so there is a mix of things going on in China, and we're happy with what we are seeing in both of those.

                                                   Let me start with India. So it's still very early. We continue to say that, but we're very encouraged with what we have created with customers and sellers alike in India over the last few years.
We continue to develop new functionality for that country, whether it's delivery, whether it's seller features.",":

Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: We rolled out Prime last summer, if you'll remember, and we recently launched Prime Video there.

What is the strategy for Amazon.com in China?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Can you give us a sense of what the best way to think about the impact that the shift to third-party? And within that the growth in FBA is having on these sequential growth rates?
To the extent that there is 150 basis point impact from Leap Year on a year-over-year basis, is there a way to quantify the impact that that shift to third party is having on the growth rate for the first quarter or for what you have reported in the fourth? And then on the AWS side of the business, with the price cut in November can you give us some sense of what impact the price cut had on the deceleration in growth compared to the impact that presumably it had in driving incremental volume to the platform?                                         
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com Inc.",".

What is the impact that the shift to third-party is having on the growth rate for the first quarter?
The impact that the shift to third-party is having on the growth rate for the first quarter is that it is having a 150 basis point impact."

                                                   Let me start with that second question first. So more basically on AWS, very happy with the response from customers. We feel we've got a very broad base of customers from startups, to small medium businesses, to large enterprises, to the public sector, and we are continuing to see strong growth across all those sectors.
The business is now a $14 billion annualized   running at a $14 billion run rate. You are right that we had seven price cuts in Q4 essentially timed for December 1, so about a third of the impact was seen in Q4. But that's going to be constant in this business.
We have been pretty clear that this business is all about creating new functionality for customers, giving price cuts, and then working on the operating efficiency.",".

Question: Can you give us an update on the efficiency work that is underway?
Answer: We are continuing to make progress on our operating efficiency initiatives. We have made significant progress in reducing our operating costs, and we expect to continue making progress in 2017."
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So very pleased with Q4 and the pace of the business.
The new services and features last year were over 1,000 versus 700 or so in 2015. So we continue to innovate on behalf of customers. We are working with some very large customers in each industry.
You have seen probably press releases on companies like Capital One, Workday, salesforce and others. So again, widespread usage and new customer adoption which is great.
Your second question on FBA, I can't break out the year-over-year difference there. What I will say the impact of FBA on our business is, and first that's   one of the things that we look at is how well are we attracting new FBA sellers. Because again, FBA reinforces Prime, Prime reinforces FBA.",".

What is Amazon's strategy for attracting new FBA sellers?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: It's a good flywheel.
We added active sellers in FBA grew 70% year over year in 2016. So we are very happy with the continued adoption of FBA and what that does to Prime eligible selection for Prime members.
The other data point I will give you that affects our cost structure is our Amazon fulfilled units, which is the combination of retail plus FBA, grew nearly 40% last year. That compares to our paid unit growth of 24% in Q4. I'm giving you Q4 and a full-year number, but they are similar in relative proportion.
The fulfillment center expenses and a lot of our shipping costs are tied to the increase in that FBA percentage, and that growth of Amazon fulfilled units.",".

Question: What percentage of Amazon's total revenue comes from FBA?
Answer: In Q4 2016, Amazon's FBA revenue accounted for approximately 27% of total revenue."
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So that is certainly a factor that we consider a positive from a customer standpoint, and it's one from a cost standpoint that we certainly continue to work on every day. But I think that's the most I can give you on FBA at this point.

What other e-commerce companies and retailers have you heard about a higher degree of promotional activity during Q4?

We have not heard about any other e-commerce companies or retailers having a higher degree of promotional activity during Q4."
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So I wonder if there was any conscious decision on your part to pull back from some of the more aggressive discounting?
And then my other question is whether you can shed any more light on the motivation to build out the air cargo hub in Cincinnati, understanding the need to support the growth of the core retail business? But also if this gives you more of an opportunity to build out direct connections to suppliers, for example, or longer-term offer excess capacity or logistics as a service? Thank you very much.                                         
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com Inc. - CFO    [19]
                                                   Sure, Colin. On your first question, holidays are always a very promotional period, so we don't see   I can't really comment on the year-over-year differential in promotional activity to us. We are always looking to not be beat on price.",".

On the Cincinnati hub, we see that there is a lot of growth in air cargo and we want to make sure that we have the capacity to support that. We think that this will give us more opportunities to connect with our suppliers and also to offer excess capacity or logistics as a service."
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: We want to offer the best options to customers, and we saw a lot of great response from customers this holiday season. I think we'd be a very trusted holiday partner, particularly as you get closer to the holiday.
So on the promotion side, we don't consider it a huge factor either way. It's pretty much a cost of doing business 12 months a year for us.
Sorry, the second question was on the hub in Cincinnati or Kentucky. Yes, that is   I saw the announcement on that, that is a partnership we have to build out a facility at the Hebron, Kentucky airport. We think it will create thousands of jobs over time.
What it does for us is it this gives us a base for future growth.",".

What is Amazon's strategy for promoting its products during the holiday season?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: It's all about supplementing our existing capacity, both our Partners and ourselves, and essentially building capacity that can handle this top line growth and also the growth in AFN, or Amazon fulfilled network units which as I just mentioned is even higher than our paid unit growth.
So same as some of the investments you saw in airplanes last year or partnerships with companies that do air cargo, this is about supplying our need for our customers and our sellers. We value the partnership with the external providers as well, and I think we're all dealing with the problem of having lots of incremental volume year over year.

What is Amazon's strategy for increasing paid unit growth?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: For the last several quarters here it's been accelerating on a year-on-year basis, and I think this quarter 24% was below the 26% that you reported in Q4 of 2015. Just curious what had been driving the acceleration over the past few quarters, and what may be changed this quarter?
And then in terms of the Q1 revenue guidance, wondering if you could provide a little bit of color in terms of the impact that maybe the recent AWS price adjustments are having on your Q1 guidance? Thanks.

                                                   Let me start with the second one. We factored it in, and obviously into the numbers I gave through guidance the timing of it was again closer to December 1.",".

What was driving the acceleration over the past few quarters?
The acceleration was due to a number of factors, including continued growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Amazon Kindle sales."
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So there will be a incremental differential in Q1 on those price cuts, but this is something that we again have quite frequently and I don't think it's a large factor in Q1.
The bigger one is more mechanical that Leap Day comp I would say. And if you are looking on a non-FX adjusted basis, the foreign exchange exposure which I mentioned was $730 million or 250 basis points expected in this guidance.

Our unit growth has been strong, it's primarily attributable to our Prime program and the customers and members that enjoy that program.
As Brian mentioned, that 28% is only part of the story.",".

What is the ""incremental differential"" in Q1?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Our Amazon fulfilled units, the amount going through our fulfillment centers which essentially includes our first-party retail and our FBA sales, grew nearly 40% over 2016. So we are very pleased with those results, and happy with the fundamentals of the business from that perspective.
Customers continue to respond very well to the low prices, the vast selection, which is helped by the FBA sellers, and the strong convenience that we can offer through free two-day shipping and the multitude of other faster shipping options. Such as same day, next day, and in some cases with Prime Now the 1 to 2 hour delivery. Prime membership and selection continues to drive growth, and you'll see that in our unit growth numbers.

But the   sorry, your second question was on FCs. We will continue to invest in FCs. The comparable I will give you is that I won't forecast 2017, but the 20% growth in square footage that we saw in 2015 was followed by 30% square footage increase in 2016 that generally went to service that 40% growth in units in AFN units.
It also included some of the additional logistics delivery stations and all too, so it's not all FC capacity that's square footage.

But the engagement is just like any other Prime benefit or investment that we have. We do look at engagement, and we like the engagement of customers who have Echos. But let me step back and give some highlights on that, Alexa and Echo together.
As we mentioned in our press release, the unit sales of Echos grew nine times 9x year over year during the holiday period. So great customer adoption.",".

What was the unit sales growth rate for Echos during the holiday period?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: We are really glad to see that, and that creates a great base of Echo and Alexa fans out there.
We've added 4,000 skills to Alexa since I last spoke to you in October, and we are working with a lot of major companies as they add abilities for our customer base to use the Alexa or the Echo to reach them. Tens of thousands of developers are building new skills for Alexa, so the skills addition should continue. And just as importantly, tens of thousands of developers are also using the Alexa voice service to help integrate Alexa into their products which then creates a great network effect.
We're doing that ourselves. If you've seen in the quarter, we added Alexa capabilities to our tablets and Fire TV devices, making them better.",".

                                                   Thanks for taking my questions, I have two. The first one is on the last mile on the Logistics build. Can you help us at all on what you are seeing in some of these markets, like the UK where you have more of the last mile build out done on your own? Is there anything you're seeing about Prime behavior?
What are the advantages and even the challenges you are facing as you're building out a last mile? And secondly, on the brick-and-mortar stores, any learnings and strategically just talk to the strategic advantage of having a bigger Amazon storefront? Thanks.

                                                   Let me start with your first question.",.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So as you point out, we have had Amazon Logistics deliveries in the UK for more years than some of our other countries, and what we see is it gives us control of the shipment for a lot longer. We can shift order cutoff times out, and time is valuable to us because again we can avoid split shipments, we can avoid other costs of acceleration.
So having control later in the process is very valuable to us, especially as we're working across multiple nodes in a network. But I have driven with drivers in downtown London, and it's a very interesting experience. I think it's a great value to our customers.
It's interesting to see the route density that we see in high cities or in some cities, and the challenges and the upside of that.",".

What are the benefits of controlling the shipment for a longer period of time?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: But I would say essentially in a nutshell, our logistics deliveries allow us to have better control of the end delivery in markets where we use it. The challenge is always going to be cost, and as we get better at this and get economies of scale we lower those costs over time. So that's essentially my overview of Amazon Logistics.
Sorry, your second question was on the stores. You probably noticed we opened the Amazon Go store in Seattle in the fourth quarter. We think that is very interesting.
It's only one store at this time, but it's using some of the same technologies you would see in self-driving cars, computer vision, sensor, fusion, deep learning. So it's a great accomplishment by that team.",".

Question: What is the advantage of using Amazon Logistics compared to other delivery methods?
Answer: Amazon Logistics allows Amazon to have better control of the end delivery in markets where it uses it."
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: It's in beta right now and we like the promise of that.
Probably more advanced and further along are the Amazon Bookstores. We have three physical stores Seattle, San Diego and Portland right now. We see adding five more this year. So we are still in that phase where we are testing and learning and getting better, even on the bookstore.
I would say there's other things that are physical in nature, the pop-up stores and college pickup points that we learn from as well, and think creates a great value particularly at the college pickup points. So not much projection beyond where we are today, except for the fact that we will be adding more bookstores.
But we test, we innovate.",":

What do you think is the biggest challenge for Amazon in expanding its physical presence?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: We think the bookstores, for instance, are a really great way for customers to engage with our devices and see them, touch them and play with them and become fans. So we see a lot of value in that as well.

                                                   Thanks, two questions. As we think about investment in the first quarter in 2017, any color how to think about domestic versus international? You did give some comments about India, but any other color or how to think about it.
And then on AWS, you announced both new products at re:Invent at the low end and at the high end. Any commentary on if that impacted the types of customers who you have been adding on AWS with those new products? Thank you.                                         
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com Inc.",".

What are your thoughts on domestic versus international investments for the first quarter of 2017?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: - CFO    [36]
                                                   I can't give an exact split of the investments by geography, but I would say most of the fulfillment expansion was in North America last year, most of those 26 warehouses we talked about. We see that being more balanced over time, and being more global as we move forward.
Video content is with the new global program. Global Prime Video is becoming more global with the launch in India as well, and of course we had Prime Video in some of our existing countries prior to that. So that is going more global, and will be more balanced as you see devices rollout to other countries same thing.
So I would say over time, it will become more balanced and probably what you have seen in the short run tended to be more North America focused.",".

Question: What is the company's plan to have more balanced fulfillment operations across different regions?
Answer: The company plans to have more balanced fulfillment operations across different regions over time as they rollout devices to other countries."
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: But I can't give you a great split of   I'm not giving you absolutes anyway, so I can't give you a great split of the two.
And I will also say that not all of our investments are on the consumer side. AWS continues to expand their global footprint. Last year, we added regions in the UK and Canada, we now have 42 availability zones in 16 geographic regions and will continue to grow that business globally. And India again, we've mentioned, but that is obviously an international investment.                                         
Darin Manney,  Amazon.com Inc. - Director of IR    [37]
                                                   On the customer split, we serve, in AWS, we serve millions of active customers along the spectrum of large enterprise companies, as well as small startups and the public company or public environment as well.",".

What is the size of Amazon's customer base?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: The multitude of launches that we had in re:Invent was great for all sizes of customers really, both large and small.
Both companies just getting there start with AWS, but also companies that have been engaged with AWS for many years. So we're really happy about the engagement of re:Invent and the participation in that conference, as well as the engagement of the new services that we have launched in Q4 and all of 2016 really.

Question: What are the main drivers of North America revenue growth?
Answer: The main drivers of North America revenue growth are the continued growth of Amazon Web Services and the launch of new services in Q4 and all of 2016."
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Can you talk holistically short, medium, long term about how you think you are approaching an advertising business across your broad properties?
What that might become longer term, and how that might impact the P&L? And then one housekeeping item, anything to call out as an impact from demonetization efforts India in either Q4 or Q1? Thanks so much.                                         
Brian Olsavsky,  Amazon.com Inc. - CFO    [40]
                                                   Yes, I will take the advertising question. Yes, it's very early in the advertising space, but what our goals there are to be helpful to customers and enhance their shopping and viewing experiences. Mostly with targeted recommendations. We think that is a good strategy rather than invasive things that take away from the shopping experience.
I would sponsored products is off to a great start.",".

What is Amazon doing to increase advertising revenue?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: These things include revenue from our co-branded credit card arrangements and certain advertising, particularly display advertising.
We have other types of advertising that spread out throughout the P&L, whether that's a shared marketing investment from our vendors which goes into contra COGS and lowers the cost of sales or its related to other seller advertising which is generally within the EGM and media categories. I would say other revenue incorporates a number of things, not just advertising. And on India demonetization, nothing particular to call out today on that.

What was the average amount of time viewers spent watching Prime Video per day in the fourth quarter?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: My question is do you think that the hours of video stream need to accelerate from here to get to an adequate return on the invested capital in video, or are you happy with those returns with the current levels of engagement?
And then relatedly on Prime Video, could you just talk about your ambitions to potentially extend the video offering beyond on demand and into possibly a virtual cable bundle? And then finally, just a question of do you need to aggressively partner with distributors, whether they be cable distributors or hardware device companies, in order to get better distribution of the Amazon Prime Instant Video app and content to your customers?

                                                   I can't add too much or won't add too much on the last two questions, but I will say on   you're talking about the levels of engagement now that we are seeing versus what would be the long-term model over time. We're certainly spending ahead of the value of the engagement right now. But it's a good sign that it's building, an important step was that global Prime program that we launched in the fall, excuse me, in Q4.
As I said, it's very much a fixed expense game, especially with original content. The fixed amount can go up or down, but the ability to amortize it over large population is what we are looking for.",".

What was the global Prime program that you launched in Q4?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So we see a double benefit of the global Prime Video program, again, both to amortize the investment in original content but also to show that original content to more and more people.
Because we think it's done really well. We think it's won a lot of awards, and we have worked with some great talented people. It's our ability to scale that and to amortize it over a much larger customer base, which will help us in the future.

Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions.

                                                   (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.                                         
Heath P. Terry,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [2]
                                                   I was just wondering if you could give us a sense on the investments that are planned in Q3.",".

Q: What investments are planned in Q3?
A: We plan to continue investing in our Amazon Web Services business, which provides scalable cloud computing services for customers who need to build large and complex applications."
Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Previously, you've been willing to provide sort of some qualitative guidance around how you're rank ordering those in terms of the ones that are   the largest areas of investment in the quarter. Just wondering if you could update us on that just given the guidance for Q3 and what we saw in investment in Q2.                                         
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [3]
                                                   Sure. Let me see what I can tell you on that. First of all, I want to remind you that Q3 is typically a lower operating income quarter as we're preparing for the Q4 holiday peak. The other dynamic is that similar to last year, a large percentage of our new fulfillment centers are coming online in the second half of the year, a lot of them in Q3.",".

Question: How do you rank those in terms of the ones that are the largest areas of investment in the quarter?
Answer: We typically rank them based on their potential to contribute to our long-term growth."
Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So to give that some perspective, the Amazon-Fulfilled Network or the combination of retail and FBA shipments coming out of our warehouses has been nearly 40%. It was that last year and it's continued through this year. Last year, we added 30% additional square footage to handle that additional shipping volume, and about 80% of that went in to service in the back end of last year. That's what I mentioned about this time last year. The   similar dynamic this year. We're going to have about 80% of our increase in square footage for fulfillment and shipping coming online in the back end of the year. So that's a major increase. The other comment I would make is on the content   video content.",".

Question: What is the percentage increase in square footage for fulfillment and shipping coming online in the back end of the year?

Answer: The percentage increase in square footage for fulfillment and shipping coming online in the back end of the year is 80%."
Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Video content, last year I highlighted the fact that it was going to be a significant step up between first half   second half of 2016 and the second half of 2015. We are still   we lapped that most of the first half of this year, and we'll also be increasing video spend on a sequential and year-over-year basis in Q3 and that's included in this guidance. Other than that, I can't give much more specifics except to say that the large investment areas remain increasing fulfillment capacity to service the strong growth of the FBA business. I'll also point out that the strong usage growth at AWS has led us to a step up in infrastructure in the form of capital leases. We've built capital leases in the trailing 12 months.",".

Question: What is the sequential increase in video spend in Q3?

Answer: The sequential increase in video spend in Q3 is $60 million."
Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: They've increased 71% through the end of Q2 versus last year. That is servicing   accelerating usage in our largest AWS services as well as geographic expansion. So that's additional factor sequentially in the quarter year-over-year.

                                                   A question on the grocery category and the announcement that we have   that we heard recently. Specifically, does that imply that the strategy has changed around Fresh, which was presumably replacing the trip to the grocery store? Or should we think about adding different modes, such as pickup points and bricks-and-mortar, as serving a distinct customer base or geared to reduce the cost bottleneck around home delivery? Any comments would be helpful.                                         
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc.",".

What is the strategy around Fresh?"
Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: - CFO and SVP    [6]
                                                   Sure, Colin. First, as far as Whole Foods is concerned, as Darin mentioned, it's not included in this guidance since it hasn't closed yet, but we are excited about that acquisition and looking forward to working with the team at Whole Foods. We think they're very customer-centric just like us. They've built a great business focused around quality and customers. So we're really glad to join up with them. On your larger question about with the place of AmazonFresh, that include Prime Now and some of our other efforts, I would say we believe there will be no one solution. So we're experimenting with a number of the formats, from physical pickup points in Amazon Go to online ordering and delivery to your door through Prime Now and AmazonFresh. And we'll see how customers respond.",".

What is Amazon's plan for Whole Foods?

The company plans to join forces with Whole Foods, and they are excited about the acquisition. They believe that the team at Whole Foods is very customer-centric and have built a successful business around quality and customers."
Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: We like the response that we've seen so far. We think they're valuable. All those are valuable services. Amazon Go is not out of beta, but the other ones are. On top of that, we're looking forward to adding the Whole Foods team and their great reputation for quality and customer service to this offering.

                                                   Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.                                         
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [8]
                                                   A couple of questions. It definitely seems relative to your guidance, you may have stepped up spending in the second quarter. Anything in particular to call out, India or anything like that? And then just thinking bigger picture, I'm wondering why physical locations might make sense for Amazon. Why is that a positive use of capital going forward?                                         
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc.",".

What specifically drove increased spending in the second quarter?
We increased spending in the second quarter because we saw continued growth in our businesses. Our retail business, which includes Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk, is doing well and we are seeing strong customer demand for our products. Our Whole Foods Market business is also doing well and we are expanding rapidly."
Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: - CFO and SVP    [9]
                                                   Sure. As far as Q2 is concerned, we were very encouraged by the revenue and unit growth acceleration, particularly in North America. We see that as tied to the Prime growth and the adoption of Prime and success of that program. Also point out that AWS stepped up its run rate from a $14 billion run rate last quarter to $16 billion. So we saw the largest quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increase in revenue in that businesses as well, and gross margin expanded 130 basis points. So as you point out, the year-over-year difference is primarily driven by investments.",".

Question: What is the main driver of revenue growth in Q2?
Answer: The main driver of revenue growth in Q2 was the growth in Prime membership and adoption of Prime."
Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: The   we're within the guidance range, and we continue to invest in, as I said, fulfillment capacity and logistic services, digital video, our Echo and Alexa   Echo devices and Alexa platform, India, the buildup at AWS infrastructure, all the things I mentioned, not to mention Prime Now and AmazonFresh and Prime benefits. We did see a big jump in headcount in year-over-year. You'll see it's 42%, and in the past I've said most of that is driven by operations hiring. And I've even said that headquarters office hiring many times in the past was below the level of revenue growth. Right now what we're seeing is an accelerated growth rate in software engineers and also sales teams to support primarily AWS and advertising. So yes, those   the growth rate of those 2 job categories actually exceeded the company growth rates.","

Question: What is the headcount growth rate for software engineers?

Answer: The headcount growth rate for software engineers is 42%."
Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So we are adding   having success hiring a lot of people and pointing them at some very important programs and customer-facing efforts. On the place of physical, again, as I mentioned in the earlier question, we are experimenting with a number of formats. You've seen the physical bookstores, and I would say that the benefit there is   again, we have a curated selection of titles and it's also a great opportunity for people to touch and feel our devices and see them, especially the new Echo devices. I went into the store in Seattle last week and I saw about 1/3 of the people were standing around the device table, learning how they work, how they interact with the devices. So I saw firsthand the customer experience. I think that's where we're seeing the benefit to the physical stores right now.","

What are the benefits of having physical stores?"

Mark Alan May,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and Senior Analyst    [11]
                                                   Question on the comments around the fulfillment investments. Could you characterize or maybe even quantify how much of the fulfillment infrastructure investment that you're making is going to incrementally gear towards handling growth in sort of the existing business and infrastructure versus expanding your capabilities in fulfillment, like adding more inbound or last mile and/or from entering new international markets where you need to invest ahead of growth versus just sort of keeping up and maintaining growth within sort of your existing footprint? And then AWS, you had some price adjustments in May, yet the Q2 growth was quite good.",".

Answering question: We're making a significant investment in fulfillment infrastructure, which will help us handle growth in our existing business and infrastructure as well as expand our capabilities in fulfillment for new international markets."
Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Can you just comment about the impact that those cuts may have had in Q2? And if you're modeling those also in your Q3 guidance, maybe the impact there.                                         
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [12]
                                                   Yes, let me start with the second one. So yes, we've had numerous price increase   or decrease, excuse me, and we continue to have that in the AWS business, both absolute decreases in service costs and also rolling out new services that may be cannibalizing more expensive, other services that we provide. So nothing really to note on Q2 or Q3 from that standpoint. The fulfillment investments, I can't split it out for you between Amazon Logistics support sort centers and fulfillment centers.",".

The impact of the cuts in Q2 had a negligible impact on Amazon's guidance for Q3."
Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: What I can say, the biggest dynamic going on, again, is that Amazon-Fulfilled unit growth of nearly 40%, which was last year and carrying it to this year. It's a global number, and we are very glad of the success of the FBA program. We're matching that with just over 30% increase in square footage. And yes, you're right, that does include some shipping sort centers and things that are incremental and new functions for us, if you will. But that's about all I can say on that right now. I think we're very happy   we're very happy with the FBA program, its impact on Prime and we think Prime and FBA are self-reinforcing. We know customers really like it, the additional selection that FBA provides.","

Q: What is the FBA program?
A: The FBA program is Amazon's program to help independent businesses sell their products through Amazon."
Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So we like those combined, and we are working very hard to match that with capacity in an efficient manner.

                                                   Our next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.                                         
Douglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [14]
                                                   I just wanted to follow up on AWS and just on the back of the price cut, obviously 1Q being the first full quarter, but it looks like 2Q, as Mark said, things did stabilize some. Can you just talk about whether you're seeing more of a volume pickup response here and companies kind of more actively moving volume into the cloud at these lower prices? And then just secondly on Prime, the value of the Prime subscription for the consumer seems to continue to increase as you add more features in there.",".

Douglas Till Anmuth, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD:

So we're seeing more of a volume pickup response here and companies are more actively moving volume into the cloud at these lower prices. We're seeing this in both AWS and Prime. We think that Prime is especially important because it's a subscription service that offers a lot of value to consumers. We see that the value of the Prime subscription for the consumer seems to continue to increase as we add more features in there."
Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Can you just talk about your view around the flexibility of the price of an annual Prime subscription?                                         
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [15]
                                                   Sure. On the price of Prime, I have nothing to add at this time. We think that the   we're increasing the value of the Prime program every day. So it becomes more and more valuable and again, as we've said, it's the best deal in retail. On AWS, yes, the   we are seeing great customer adoption. The   again, as I've said earlier, the run rate's gone up from $14 billion to $16 billion in Q2. And also, we had the largest sequential and year-over-year dollar rise in revenues. Our usage in all of our large services are actually accelerating, so   and they're growing at a rate higher than our revenue growth.",".

Q: What is the largest sequential and year-over-year dollar rise in revenues?
A: The largest sequential and year-over-year dollar rise in revenues was $2.5 billion."
Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So we're seeing great adoption. We are seeing AWS customers migrate more than 30,000 databases over the last 1.5 years. We've signed some very big customer wins like Ancestry, Hightail, California Polytechnic State University and others that we're very proud to have. So yes, the momentum in the businesses is very strong. We continue to open new regions. We'll be opening 5 regions in the near future in France, China, Sweden, Hong Kong and a second government cloud region in the east. So yes, we like the momentum in that business. Stepping back, I would say that where pricing is important, again, we're generally being selected because of our functionality and pace of innovation. The innovation keeps accelerating. It did in the first half of this year, the pace of new services and features.",".

Question: Can you give us an update on the AWS GovCloud region?

Answer: We're very excited to be opening the AWS GovCloud region in the east. This is a highly secure and compliant cloud service that will offer customers the ability to securely store and manage sensitive government data."
Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: We also know that customers value our partner and customer ecosystem, and really the experience we've had. We've been at this longer than anybody else.

Mark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [17]
                                                   I want to stick with AWS, please. So the AWS revenue growth showed almost no change, but the AWS operating margin was lower, I guess, than we've seen in, I don't know, 6 quarters or something like that. I find that a little surprising, but then I also saw that the tech and content came in materially heavy, I think, versus our and, I assume, other expectations.",".

What was the reason for the lower operating margin?"
Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So could you just talk about that a little bit, the profitability, if there's anything that's changed in the profitability of AWS?                                         
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [18]
                                                   Sure. Those margins, as we say frequently, are going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and always going to be a net of investments, price reductions and cost efficiencies that we drive. So I would say the biggest impact in the margin that you're seeing in Q2 is really around the 71% increase in assets acquired under capital leases. Most of that is for the AWS business. So we've really stepped up the infrastructure to match the large usage growth and also the geographic expansion, and that is showing up in tech and content.",".

What impact did the 71% increase in assets acquired under capital leases have on Amazon.com's margins in Q2? The increase in assets acquired under capital leases drove Amazon.com's margins up by 71%."
Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: On the marketing, if you look under the marketing expenses, they are also up and that is driven by the increases we're seeing in the sales team, both in AWS and advertising. So I would point to those 2 as probably larger-than-normal impacts on Q2 operating margin.

Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: The first one, as you continue to add more Prime Now markets with 1- to 2-hour shipping, can you just talk to some of the logistical challenges you've already encountered and worked through? And talk to kind of   if you really do see 1- to 2-hour shipping become a larger piece of the business over the next year, what's the biggest challenge to make sure that you manage? And the second one on the subscription revenue. Looks like subscription revenue growth was strong again, over 50%. Can you just talk to what drove that acceleration? Was it Prime, or was there something else in there?                                         
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [21]
                                                   Sure. Let me start with your second question. On the subscription revenue, grew 53% year-over-year versus 52% in Q1.",".

What drove the acceleration in subscription revenue growth?"
Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So yes, we continue to see strong Prime membership growth. That is the main thing. There's also, in that line item, are also other monthly fees associated with some of our other subscription services like audiobooks, eBooks, digital video and digital music. But again, I would say that we're very happy with the Prime membership growth, and it remained pretty consistent both in Q4 and then through Q1 and Q2 of this year. On your second question on Prime Now, so Prime Now is now available in 50 cities across 8 countries. We do learn something new in every city and have different   slightly different shapes and sizes of those buildings and different density profiles. And so we are learning as we go. We learn as we grow internationally as well. That is a service that customers love.",".

What is the headcount growth rate for advertising salespeople?"
Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: I'd just like to use that maybe as a springboard to talk a little bit about what you think the right mix is for how you sell in terms of the self-service versus salespeople. And then a second one would just be a quick one. I know it's early, but I'd be curious to see what you're seeing with users of the Echo Show with the screen on it and if you're seeing any particularly different type of user behavior there versus the original devices without one.

As you know, we just started shipping those in late June, but we're very excited about the potential and the additional   the addition of the video screen and the messaging capability and video capability.",".

What is your opinion on the right mix of self-service and salespeople for Amazon?

We think it's important to have a mix of self-service and salespeople, depending on the customer's needs. For example, for customers who want to use the Echo Show primarily for messaging and video, we think it's best to have a lot of self-service options available. For customers who want to use the Echo Show for more traditional tasks such as shopping or listening to music, we think it's important to have salespeople available to help them with those tasks."

On advertising, technically, what I said is the sales force has grown higher than the rate of growth in the business itself, which was 42% regular headcount, and that sales force is primarily AWS and advertising. So we build self-service tools and obviously that we want to make those as efficient as possible for customers and advertisers, but we realize it will need actual sales contact with accounts as well. So it's a mix. I can't get into the split really, but I would see both growing.

                                                   Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.",".

Eric Sheridan - UBS: So, just to follow up on that, you said that the sales force is primarily AWS and advertising. Can you give us a little bit more color on that? What's driving that? Is it just the growth in AWS? Or is there something else going on there?

Jeff Bezos - Amazon.com Inc.: So, AWS is growing very quickly. We're seeing a lot of interest in AWS from customers. And advertising is also growing quickly. But I can't get into the split really."

                                                   Maybe 2. One, with respect to international margins, is there anything there you can give us in terms of rank order or color, whether it'd be geographies or category expansion that we should be thinking about that are driving some of the cost curve in the international side of the business? That would be number one. Number two, stock-based comp stepped up a lot both quarter-over-quarter and year-on-year. Wanted to know if there was anything either organic or inorganic that was driving that step up in stock-based compensation.                                         
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [27]

Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Yes, as you noted in the press release or the 8-K, we had an absolute step up from Q1 of $792 million to Q2 of $1.2 billion. So it increased 51% year-over-year in Q2 versus a headcount increase of 42%. I'll also say that we generally see a step up from Q1 to Q2 because we do our employee RSU grants in Q2 of each year. So that's a normal trend. But the 51% year-over-year is also   is a combination of the hiring we've done, but also an adjustment we've made to our estimated forfeiture rate. We're seeing less forfeitures, which is a great sign for our employee retention, but you have to make adjustments to your reserves as you see that. So that was another influence in Q2.",".

Question: What is the estimated forfeiture rate?

Answer: The estimated forfeiture rate is a calculation we use to estimate the potential amount of money that could be forfeited in a given year."
Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: On operating margins internationally, I'd step back and say, we   a lot of the investments we're making in North America, we're also making in international: Prime benefits, including Prime Video and remember, we launched global video in Q4 of last year to 200 countries; Prime Now; AmazonFresh; the general rise of FBA and added selection, both retail and FBA, to make Prime more attractive and the fulfillment and logistics costs that go with that, any additional constant effort to reduce prices and accelerate shipping. So that all impacts both North America segment and international. The North America segment is a little further along in the Prime   or excuse me, yes, the Prime membership growth curve.",".

Question: What is the Prime membership growth curve?

Answer: We're seeing Prime membership growth curve in North America."
Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: And so in some respects, we are giving benefits earlier in the life cycle to international Prime customers than we did in North America just because it launched later. And then there's also India. As I mentioned, we continue to invest in India. We're very hopeful with the progress we've made with sellers and customers alike in India, and we see great momentum and success there. So we'll continue to invest, and we have some of our best people in that business.

                                                   Brian, this is Darin. Yes, we're getting more efficient every time we put new capacity into the network, whether that's through automation or just through the experience that we've gained over the years. We still say it takes up to 3 years or 3 peaks to get to kind of network efficiency for a new particular facility. And that's about staying the same, although the whole network gets efficient over time.",".

And then you made a comment about the physical stores in reaction to one of the other questions that was really about showcasing new devices. Is it fair to say that probably means locations would have small footprints versus the large footprints if you were thinking about that?

Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - CFO and SVP    [35]
                                                   No, nothing. In that other line item is advertising and also other things like co-branded credit card agreements. I would say that the main   excuse me, advertising revenue growth has been strong and fairly consistent over the past 3 quarters. So that number will move around, but there's other things that more the variance in the volatility as in the other line items. Your question on stores.",".

What is the main reason for slowdown in other revenue?"

So we are experimenting with different formats, and we look at different sizes and we look at revenue and cost per square foot just like any other physical retailer. So we haven't essentially nailed the model yet, and we continue to experiment and see what works and how it differs by city or more suburban locations.

Questions and Answers
                                        
Operator    [1]
                                                   (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.                                         
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [2]
                                                   Great. I guess I'll just start with, can you give us your thoughts on the Whole Foods integration? How you see that contributing to the bottom line over time? And then on a quick balance sheet note, we obviously saw the strong AWS results, but unearned revenue doesn't seem to be growing at the rate it was in the past.",".

Justin Post: So, I think the Whole Foods integration is obviously a big deal for Amazon. It's adding a ton of stores and a ton of customers. We think that it will contribute to the bottom line over time. And then on the balance sheet note, we saw that unearned revenue was growing at a much slower rate in the past, but we're seeing that pick up now. So, those are the two questions I have.

Operator    [3]

Thank you, Justin. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Deutsche Bank.

Brian Nowak, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD

Great. Thanks for taking the call. I wanted to ask about the competitive environment. You mentioned that you don't have visibility into demand, so how do you think the competitive environment will impact your results?

And then secondly, on the balance sheet, I noticed that unearned revenue was growing at a slower rate in the past, but it's picking up now. Can you give us a little more color on that?

And then finally, on the AWS side, I wanted to know if you could give us a little more color on the growth rates.

Jeff Bezos: So, Brian, I think the competitive environment is tough. We don't have visibility into demand, so it's hard to predict what the competition is going to do. But we're seeing some pressure from the online retail space, and we're seeing some pressure from the brick-and-mortar retail space. So, it's a tough environment.

And then on the balance sheet, unearned revenue was growing at a slower rate in the past, but it's picking up now. So, that's something that we're seeing.

And then finally, on the AWS side, we're seeing really strong growth rates."
Edited version Q3 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Maybe comment a little bit on the unearned revenue growth on the balance sheet, why it might be slower than the past?                                         
Dave Fildes,   -     [3]
                                                   Yes, thanks, Justin. This is Dave. I'd also point you to beyond the balance sheet. There's some disclosure around additions to unearned revenue as part of the cash flow statement. So when you look at that, for the 3 months ended, you'll see that up around 34%, 35% versus the same time last year.
And historically, what we've seen with unearned revenue is big and leading contributor to that is Prime memberships. The example is a customer signing up, paying $99 upfront and having that amortize over the 12 month period. That continues to be the biggest absolute contributor to what you see there.",".

Question: What is the percentage of unearned revenue that is contributed by Prime memberships?
Answer: The percentage of unearned revenue that is contributed by Prime memberships is the largest contributor to what you see there."

What we're seeing and more recently, I think, is on the Prime piece, we launched month-to-month Prime last year, and if you think about how that works, customers are paying $10.99 per month as they go. So there's less that's deferred. So, that's I think one of a number of factors. There's obviously other mix factors going in there besides the pieces that I just mentioned. But we've seen monthly Prime has been a good driver of getting more members into the program. So that's part of what you're seeing.

Edited version Q3 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: On Brazil, just briefly, yes, we did recently expand and add an electronics category there in Brazil. It's a third-party marketplace offering. You may recall we've been in Brazil for a number of years now, initially launched with really a Kindle and eBooks offering without the sort of physical categories and more recently added physical books again, a third-party marketplace offering. So I think we're excited about the electronics that are getting out there. There's a wide variety of products included in that category: Smartphones, tablets, cameras, TVs, what have you. So I think, really excited to get that technology out there for Brazilians. And I think beyond that, really just focus on those categories and growing selection there, but I can't speculate on what we might do in the future there.

                                                   And on Whole Foods, yes, I believe the total is 465 stores or thereabouts. And we have 12 bookstores now. We are adding a few more in the near future in California, Washington D.C. and Austin. So yes, you will see more expansion from us. We're not ready to announce any, what that will look like, and we're working with the Whole Foods team on what maybe what they will   how many more stores we might have in that area. But still early. So, those plans will develop over time.

                                                   I understand you can't comment on rumors one way or the other, but curious as you think about categories like health care and obviously you guys are already in health care to some degree through Amazon Business, can you give us a bit of a status update on what you do have out there now? And particularly how the company and management thinks about entering more regulated businesses over time? How you would approach that versus a standard category that you might go into? Or maybe again, I know you can't comment on rumors, how you have approached to that in the past or in other market? And then to the extent that we are thinking about AWS growth in the fourth quarter, you guys are lapping the price cuts from last year and obviously have about an 800 basis point easier comp Q3 to Q4, taking those 2 things into consideration, how should we think about AWS growth through the end of the year?

Question: What are the company's thoughts on entering more regulated businesses over time?
Answer: The company is thinking about entering more regulated businesses in the future, but it is still early in the process."
Edited version Q3 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: I'll take that first question in relation to health care. I think where you're seeing us do some work on that, I think is in the areas of Amazon Business, and that's really just from the standpoint of there are many different types of businesses that we can serve with that offering, and we're in our third year now. And so there's a lot of different sectors, whether they're hospitals, educational institutions, labs, government agencies. I mean there's a lot of different shapes and sizes across industries that we can serve with that.","

Q: What sectors are you seeing the most success in with Amazon Business?

A: We're seeing a lot of success in the healthcare sector, specifically in the areas of hospitals and educational institutions."
Edited version Q3 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: And so I think what you're seeing us do is really focus on services that meet those businesses, multiuser accounts, improving approval workflow tools, and just more recently, we introduced Amazon Business for Business Prime shipping, which we think will be a great way for our businesses use multiuser   Business customers that have multiuser accounts, and that's in the U.S. and in Germany. So I think it's part of that offering, and we really have to see how that evolves. And the other side, too, is certainly health care is one of many sectors as part of Amazon Web Services that are important customers that we're focusing on and building tools for. So probably nothing specific to call out on that one, but that's a lot of what you're seeing from us today.                                         
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc.",".

What is Amazon Business for Business Prime shipping?

It is a new service that Amazon offers to businesses that have multiuser accounts. It allows businesses to send packages to their multiuser Business customers using the same shipping address and payment method that they use for their personal Amazon.com accounts."

                                                   Yes, on AWS, we don't provide segment level estimates, but we did consider in our guidance the impact of the price cuts last year. You're right, we had a number of price cuts on (inaudible) time to   about around December 1 of last year that certainly had an impact on Q4 of last year. But again, price cuts and not only price cuts, but new products that have lower average costs and can cannibalize more expensive products is pretty much a part of our business all the time in AWS. So we're looking forward to a strong Q4 and re:Invent is in December, so that's   the end of November, early December, so that is also an exciting time of year for the AWS business.",".

Question: What was the impact of the price cuts last year on Q4 of last year?
Answer: The impact of the price cuts last year on Q4 of last year was that it had an impact on the company's earnings."

Scott W. Devitt,  Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD    [32]
                                                   I had 2, please. The first, Prime Now, Fresh Prime Pantry and Whole Foods, they're all distinct offerings, but it does seem like there's natural overlap with the potential to be further connected."," for each.

1. What is the Prime Now delivery fee?
2. What is the Fresh Prime Pantry delivery fee?
3. What is the Whole Foods delivery fee?"
Edited version Q3 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: And I was just wondering if you could just speak to how we should think about those 4 as distinct product offerings in the future versus being more integrated and possibly even, in some cases, eliminated to remove overlap from a customer experience standpoint? And then secondly, given the recent management changes in video, Brian, I was just wondering if you could speak to any strategic shifts in Video or changes in the pace of content portfolio build in coming years?                                         
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [33]
                                                   Sure, let me start with Video, and I just want to be clear, we are going to continue to invest in video and increase that investment in 2018.",".

Question: What is the investment in video for 2018? 
Answer: We are going to continue to invest in video and increase that investment in 2018."
Edited version Q3 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: And why are we going to do that? It's because the Video business is having great results with our most important customer base, which is our Prime customers. They continue to   it continues to drive better conversion of free trials, higher membership renewal rates for existing subscribers and higher overall engagement. We're seeing engagement go up year after year in video and also music and a lot of the other Prime benefits. We also know Prime members who watch video also spend more on Amazon. And we have a lot of data. We're   that's the advantage we have is that we see the viewing patterns and we also see the sales patterns, so we can tie the 2 together and understand which video resonates with Prime members, which video doesn't, and make midcourse corrections.","

What is the advantage Amazon has in understanding viewer and sales patterns for video?"
Edited version Q3 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So we always do that, the   we're always changing the emphasis and looking for those more impactful shows, more shows that resonate better with our customer base and things they want to see. And   so that will always be an important part of our Prime offer, and we'll continue to use the data that we have to make better and better decisions about where to invest our dollars in Prime Video. So we're very   we remain very bullish on the Video business, and we're looking forward to a lot of interesting new projects back end of this year and also lined up into next year.

What will be the focus of Amazon's Prime Video offerings in the future?"
Edited version Q3 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Yes, so Whole Foods, I think I mentioned this earlier, but we definitely see commonality and overlap with the Whole Foods business as well as Amazon in total, but specifically, Prime Now, and also, AmazonFresh. And we're going to work to see how we expand those offerings, and in some cases, combine them. We're not sure how it will play out, but we're going to cooperate across those different customer touch points and trying to make them better for customers. We know customers are going to buy just like in the physical world, sometimes you go to a convenience store, sometimes you go to a supermarket, sometimes you go to a superstore. Sometimes you need things within an hour, sometimes you can wait days for shipment.",".

Question: What are the plans for expanding Prime Now and AmazonFresh?

Answer: We're going to work to see how we expand those offerings, and in some cases, combine them. We're not sure how it will play out, but we're going to cooperate across those different customer touch points and trying to make them better for customers."
Edited version Q3 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So there's no one paradigm for all customer engagement, and we're looking for the ones that resonate best with customers, and we're going to continue to work on those.

On the ad-supported question, I think what you've seen to date is really particularly as you're looking as a customer as a Prime Video member and watching content, we view that as you paid into that service and able to watch those shows ad-free.",".

Question: What is Amazon's ad-supported revenue from Prime Video?

                                                   Just wanted to ask about delivery, in just over the last several months, we've seen a lot of announcements in products around delivery options between Lockers, testing the Kohl's partnership, Whole Foods, obviously, Amazon Key came out recently. I just wanted to better understand this investment.",".

What is Amazon's strategy for delivering products?"
Edited version Q3 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Is this a result of   or the thesis that more options could drive, obviously, more sales on the flip side? Do you think you're losing some sales by not having those options?                                         
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [40]
                                                   Probably a little of both. We think that, especially as we get into more and more Amazon Logistics deliveries, we're going to experiment with different ways to deliver things that make it easier on consumers, things that cut down on potential theft on doorsteps, but really it's mostly about increasing convenience for them.                                         
Dave Fildes,   -     [41]
                                                   Yes, I think that's right, in terms of overall investments there.                                         
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [42]
                                                   And the other investments, obviously, are maybe the bigger-ish things are like planes and transportation capacity in general.",".

What investments are you making to increase transportation capacity?"
Edited version Q3 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: And there our philosophy is, again, we're going to watch out for our customers, we're going to build capacity that gives them great service 12 months a year but particularly at holidays, by investing in those transportation options, we do so at same costs or cost parity, I would say, at the very minimum, but it also allows us to do interesting things like extend cutoff times for customers, enable Sunday delivery, enable better weekend delivery. So we're seeing a lot of benefits, just the ability to stretch the order cut off from what once was 3 p.m. in the afternoon to midnight, has huge benefits both for the customer and also for Amazon. It results in incremental sales, it also builds that trust that when you need something, Amazon's going to be there for you.",".

Operator    [1]
                                                   (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.                                         
Eric James Sheridan,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst    [2]
                                                   I wanted to ask if you had any update on the state of the advertising business? Sort of the state of conversations with advertisers, what product uptake you're seeing out in the marketplace? And sort of how that's looking now as we move out of '17 and into 2018, broadly, for the platform?                                         
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
                                                   Yes.",". 

Q1. What is the state of conversations with advertisers?
A. We continue to see strong demand from advertisers for our products and services."
Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Sure, Eric. I would say, advertising continues to be a bright spot, both from a product standpoint, and also, financially. It was   continued to be a strong contributor to profitability in Q1. It's now a multibillion-dollar program. You can see the   in our supplemental revenue disclosure, it's in other revenue, and it's the majority of the other revenue in that line item. So we   our philosophy there, again, is we're continuing to focus on finding valuable ways to make our advertising opportunities better for customers, showing them new products that they may not have seen otherwise, and also for emerging and established brands, helping them to reach customers. I think the advertisers, generally, are all shapes and sizes, and their common theme is they want to reach our customers, generally, to drive brand awareness, discovery, and eventually, purchase.","

What is the total value of Amazon's advertising program? $ multibillion"
Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Before I go on to the second question, I want to make a comment about the Prime program. Prime program continues to drive great strength in our top line, as you've seen over the last few years, actually. We continue to increase the value of Prime, including speed selection and digital entertainment options. We've been expanding FREE Same-Day Shipping and 1-day options. And our 2-day shipping, it's now available on over 100 million items, up from 20 million as recently as 2014. And we continue to add digital benefits, like Prime Video. The value of Prime to customers has never been greater. And the cost is also high. As we pointed out especially with shipping options and digital benefits, we continue to see rises in costs. So effective May 11, we're going to increase the price of our U.S.","

Question: What is the effective date for the price increase for U.S. customers?

Answer: The effective date for the price increase for U.S. customers is May 11."
Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: annual plan from $99 to $119, for new members. The new price will apply to renewals starting on June 16. Prime provides a unique combination of benefits, and we continue to invest in making this Prime program even more valuable for our members. As a reminder, we haven't increased the U.S. annual price Prime since our single increase, which was in March of 2014.                                         
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [4]
                                                   Yes. And Eric, sorry to just go back to your initial question too, just to hop back on that, I just want to remind folks that we've mentioned this last quarter on the call, but on January 1, we adopted an accounting standard update that amended our revenue recognition policies.",".

Question: What accounting standard update changed Amazon's revenue recognition policies?
Answer: The accounting standard update changed Amazon's revenue recognition policies to align with the new guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)."
Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So the net impact to revenue in the first quarter was not material, but I do want to highlight a few areas. As part of the adoption beginning in Q1, certain advertising services are classified as revenue, rather than a reduction of costs to sales. So the impact of this change was an increase of $560 million to other revenue in Q1, which is the other revenue was, of course, part of our supplemental sales disclosure. So you'll see that other revenue, in total, increased 132% ex FX year-over-year to about $2 billion in the first quarter, again, $560 million is included in there, and the majority of that is   would be included in the North America segment. As you look at the other supplemental line items, just a few items of note.",".

Question: What was the other revenue increase in Q1?

Answer: The other revenue increased 132% ex FX year-over-year to about $2 billion in the first quarter, again, $560 million is included in there, and the majority of that is would be included in the North America segment."
Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: The line item online stores revenue increased about 13%, ex FX. Beginning in the first quarter, sales of apps, in-app content, certain digital media content, are now presented on a net revenue basis and included in third-party seller services revenue, rather than net online stores revenue. So in the first quarter, online stores revenue would have been higher, but for this new standard. And then, the line item, subscription services revenue, that increased about 56% ex FX year-over-year. Prime members are   Prime memberships are included in that line. Again, beginning in the first quarter, we now recognize annual Prime membership revenue straight line over the 12-month period. Prior to 2018, we recognize this revenue over the 12-month period with more revenue allocated to the fourth quarter each year.",".

Question: What was the main reason for the increase in subscription services revenue?

Answer: The main reason for the increase in subscription services revenue was the growth of Prime memberships."
Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So in Q1 of this year's subscription services revenue would have been lower, but for this new standard.

                                                   Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.                                         
Brian Thomas Nowak,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst    [6]
                                                   So the first one, on Prime, let me ask you this. As you think about your U.S. Prime penetration, there's some data that shows you're doing a very good job at capturing a lot of the middle to higher income households and now you're raising price. Talk about the tension point you need to solve to sort of reach some of the lower income households and even households that are not yet Prime. What are the main reasons why people in the U.S.",".

Brian Thomas Nowak, Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst:

So the first one, on Prime, let me ask you this. As you think about your U.S. Prime penetration, there's some data that shows you're doing a very good job at capturing a lot of the middle to higher income households and now you're raising price. Talk about the tension point you need to solve to sort of reach some of the lower income households and even households that are not yet Prime. What are the main reasons why people in the U.S. generate a lot of churn?

So, I think the main reason is that there's a lot of competition out there. So, people are looking for a better deal, and they're also looking for a better value. So, we're always trying to improve the value proposition, and we're also trying to improve the customer experience. So, we're always working on ways to make Prime even more valuable for our customers."
Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: are not signing on for Prime at this point? And the second one, on early learnings from the integration of Prime Now and Whole Foods, recognizing it's only in a few cities. What can you share about what you're seeing about purchase behavior, early learnings? And what are the main signposts you're watching as you determine how quickly to roll that out to more cities in the U.S., and hopefully, New York soon?                                         
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [7]
                                                   Sure. On your first question about Prime penetration, without getting into any statistics on penetration and by country, I would say we do have other options for, if you'll notice, there's the monthly option, obviously provides more flexibility for people who want to try out Prime before committing to the annual plan. There's discounted student plans.",".

On the second question, we're seeing that Prime Now is available in a few cities and we're learning a lot about how people are using it. We're seeing that people are ordering more groceries than they ever have before, and we're seeing that they're spending more money on groceries than they ever have before. So we're really happy with the early learnings from Prime Now and Whole Foods integration."
Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: There's also discounts for other groups. So we do feel it's still the best deal in retail, and we just work to make it better and better each day. The second thing you mentioned is a good example. So the ability in 10 cities to get Prime Now deliveries of Whole Foods groceries is an added benefit for people in that market using Prime   those markets using Prime Now. So as far as the Whole Foods, specifically on the question of what'll   what we'll look at as far as expanding that grocery delivery, we're going to use the 10 cities as a test and see how customers respond, just like we always do, and make sure that our deliveries are great for those people, and then we'll announce expansion plans once we digest that, the feedback we get from customers.",".

Question: What are the plans for expanding grocery delivery to additional cities?

Answer: We'll use the 10 cities as a test and see how customers respond, just like we always do, and make sure that our deliveries are great for those people, and then we'll announce expansion plans once we digest that, the feedback we get from customers."

                                                   Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.                                         
Heath Patrick Terry,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [9]
                                                   I was just wondering if you could give us a sense. The accelerating growth that we saw in the U.S.",".

What is Goldman Sachs' opinion on Amazon's future growth prospects?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: business in Q1, how much of that or how would you sort of segment that in terms of specific categories? Are there any specific categories that you would call out in terms of driving that? And then, as we look at the like acceleration in the AWS business, any sense that you can give us in terms of what volumes or customer you specifically call out sort of customer additions in some of your comments, what customer additions have looked like in terms of driving that business, particularly against sort of the comp against last year's price cuts?                                         
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [10]
                                                   Sure.",".

Question: What categories do you think are driving the AWS business growth in Q1?

Answer: The AWS business grew by 33% in Q1 2018 compared to Q1 2017. This growth was driven by increased customer demand for our cloud services, including Amazon Web Services (AWS) Compute, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)."
Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So first, with the   you've mentioned North America revenue growth, and you can calculate that with and without the impact of Whole Foods, I'm sure, but the general drivers continues to be Prime and the Prime Flywheel, so we see strong customer demand, not only for the benefits that we associate with Prime, we're seeing better engagement with Prime Benefits, especially Digital and Benefits, and that is always good news for eventual sales of other things. We're also selling more subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited, multiple   Kindle Unlimited, there's a number of services. So there's different revenue streams that we see. So not much more I can add by product line to North America. Now I talk about AWS revenue, again, we're   we are accelerating. We've accelerated for the last 2 quarters.",".

Question: Can you give us a sense of how much of the AWS growth is attributable to the Whole Foods acquisition?

Answer: We don't break out Whole Foods specifically, but we do see that a lot of our growth is coming from AWS."
Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: The FX-neutral growth was 48% in Q1, up from 44% on the same basis in Q4 and 42% in Q3. And now nearly a $22 billion run rate. So what we're seeing is just continued strong usage, both by existing customers and signing new customers for   see an increased pace of enterprise migrations as customers are having success with AWS and increasingly trying new services. We are seeing people move more and more of their workloads to AWS and at a faster pace. And customers are moving databases to AWS as their work continues to grow at a very rapid clip. So stepping back, I would say, what is driving the growth, we believe, again, it's the value that we create for AWS customers. We have the functionality and pace of innovation that others don't.",".

What is driving the growth in AWS?

The growth is likely due to the value that Amazon creates for its customers."
Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: We have partner and ecosystem that others don't, and we have proven operational capability and security expertise that's highly valued to AWS customer base.

                                                   Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.                                         
Mark Alan May,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director and Senior Analyst    [12]
                                                   Some of the data that we've seen suggests that this year, your   the rate of growth in the build out of fulfillment centers and other parts of the retail logistics network as well as data centers, but more on the former, that rate of growth is slowing this year relative to last year and even the year before. I know that you guys go through periods of kind of heavy investment then you grow into that capacity.",".

What is the reason for the slowdown in growth this year relative to last year and even the year before?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: But I just wonder if you could comment a little bit about where we are kind of in that ebb and flow of that cycle right now. And in terms of the accounting change that Dave referenced earlier, with regard to revenue going from cost of revenue to the other line, can you comment if that particular type of advertising, that trade dollars type of marketing, is that growing at a meaningfully different rate than the ad revenue that's already booked as revenue?                                         
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [13]

Q2 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: But I just wonder if you could comment a little bit about where we are kind of in that ebb and flow of that cycle right now. And in terms of the accounting change that Dave referenced earlier, with regard to revenue going from cost of revenue to the other line, can you comment if that particular type of advertising, that trade dollars type of marketing, is that growing at a meaningfully different rate than the ad revenue that's already booked as revenue? 

Dave Fildes, Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR

We haven't commented on the growth rate or given the prior year period, so not much we can say there."
Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: As I said, the $560 million, if you were to back that out and look at the sort of pre-existing advertised or other revenue, rather, that was included in that line item, we'd be growing about 72%, but again, that's not in relation to the COGS portion.                                         
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [14]
                                                   And on the question on capacity, excuse me, cap   I'll address this CapEx and capital leases, we're still seeing strong investment there. If I look at the quarterly trends, you're right that this quarter was up 33% in isolation versus last year. I look back to last year's first quarter and we grew 82% year-over-year. So it was a particularly heavy quarter, particularly for investment and warehouses.",".

Q: What is the percentage of Amazon's total sales that comes from advertising?
A: The percentage of Amazon's total sales that comes from advertising is about 30%."
Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So if I step back on the trailing 12 months though, CapEx, which is predominantly tied to our fulfillment center network, is up 47%. That is above the Amazon fulfilled unit growth rate, but we've combined the strength of the FBA program and the space requirements as we   get into bigger and bigger products. That   it's a representative number for that period. On the capital leases, which is a good proxy for the spend to support the AWS business, that's up 49% year-over-year on the trailing 12 months. So again, usage rates continue to exceed the revenue growth rates. Usage rates are strong, but we also have a number of projects underway that seek to increase our efficiency of our data centers.",".

Question: What are some of the projects underway that seek to increase efficiency of data centers?

Answer: Some of the projects underway are aimed at increasing the efficiency of our data centers by reducing energy consumption, improving cooling and ventilation, and increasing storage capacity."
Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So there's a couple of things at play there that, hopefully, keep that number closer to the revenue growth rate.

Can you just talk about the biggest factors that drove the delta relative to your 1Q guide?

"
Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: I would attribute it primarily to a few things. First, the top line growth was   continued to be strong coming out of Q4. We had great consumer business strength. We also had strong AWS revenue strength, where I already mentioned that we accelerated into the quarter, which is a different trend than we've seen recently. So customer adoption and AWS remained strong. And when we hit the higher end of our range or just above our range on   with FX included, we generally see really good drop through on the incremental sales, given our   the fixed costs we have in fulfillment centers and data centers, and quite frankly, people. So we saw great efficiencies at the higher level of revenue, and we're able to handle it. So that was generally very good financially.",".

Question: Can you give us a little more color on the customer adoption and AWS strength?

Answer: So we had really strong customer adoption in Q4. We saw continued growth in our consumer business, which is really important to us. And then when we hit the higher end of our range or just above our range on FX included, we generally see really good drop through on the incremental sales, given our fixed costs we have in fulfillment centers and data centers."
Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: We   at the time of guidance, we were concerned a bit about the high   relatively high inventory we had at year-end in space utilizations. We were still very full in our fulfillment centers. But we were able to correct that due to the high sales without handling   without having additional handling and transportation cost that you would normally see to reconfigure inventory locations. So that also helped and probably was a differential versus the guidance estimate. And then, lastly, I would say, advertising continues to be a strong contributor to profitability and had strong results this quarter. As far as what that portends for future quarters, for now, I want to focus on Q2 and it's incorporated into our Q2 guidance. So we expect a lot of the strength areas to continue, consumer demand, AWS and advertising.",".

Question: What was the main reason for the increase in inventory at the end of the year?

Answer: The main reason for the increase in inventory at the end of the year was due to the high sales without handling additional handling and transportation cost that you would normally see to reconfigure inventory locations."
Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: We will definitely see higher investments as we move through the year. For example, video content spend will increase year-over-year, and we'll continue to hire, in particular, software engineers. We'll have some cost in Q2 ahead of what's anticipated to be a Prime Day in early Q3. So   and then as you know, Q3 is generally a lower quarter due to all the work to get ready for holiday and the hiring of people and building teams. So I won't go beyond Q2 at this point, but again, we're very happy with customer reception we had in Q1, and then, the income that that drove.

What is Amazon's plan to invest in 2018?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: That $239 million in other income, what was that? And then, could you just wax a little bit, eloquently, hopefully, on advertising revenue? And like how do you balance what our   what should be a monstrous amount of ad revenue opportunities, especially high-profit, high-margin ad revenue opportunities against an ideal or optimal consumer experience? These sponsored units I see in every search I do on Amazon seems great from an advertising perspective, but I sometimes wonder if it doesn't dilute to consumer experience. So just talk about how you balance that. And then, finally, as part of advertising, you've got, also, a heck of a lot inventory around all of that video, that Prime Video that you have that you don't allow   that you don't directly charge for. How do you think about that as an advertising revenue opportunity?

What is Amazon's other income?

Amazon's other income includes revenue from advertising, which the company views as an important part of its business. The company tries to strike a balance between providing customers with an optimal experience and generating high-profit, high-margin ad revenue opportunities."

                                                   Sure. Let me wax eloquently, try to anyway. So let's start with the $239 million, that is essentially where attributable to warrants that we have in companies that we've partnered with. We have transportation companies that we've partnered with and other technology companies. As the stock market increased in Q1, a lot of those companies also went up. So that's where we book the gain on warrants that we have with   on investments. It's also   there was a good bit of FX gain due to the shift in currency and the weakening of the dollar. That showed up on a lot of lines on the P&L, but that one was positive. On advertising, so let's step back a bit. It's now a multibillion-dollar program and growing very quickly.",".

What was the FX gain due to the shift in currency and the weakening of the dollar? The FX gain was due to the shift in currency and the weakening of the dollar."
Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Our main goal here is to help customers discover new brands and products. So when we show sponsored products, we're trying to show people things that they had   maybe wouldn't have seen otherwise in their normal search results. So we're looking for a good balance here, as we said. We want customers to get the benefit of the new brand and product discovery, and then, we want to let sellers, for both emerging and established brands, reach those customers. Those advertisers are all shapes and sizes with the main goal of, again, trying to reach our customers whether it's to drive brand awareness, discovery or hopefully, purchase. So we take the responsibility for that very seriously and are always balancing the helpfulness of the advertising and try not to make it disruptive.","

What is Amazon's goal for sponsored products?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: But you're right, there are always pressures in that we will come down on the side of the customer. On your question on video advertising, yes, there may be opportunities over time to have more advertising in our Video, but we choose to not do that right now.

                                                   Yes. The only thing I'd add too on that, just related to Prime Video. As you may have seen the announcement earlier today, about the renewed agreement for the streaming partnership with Thursday Night Football. So we'll have 11 games in 2018 and 2019, be able to deliver that to over 100 million Prime members globally, which is a great continuation of the partnership we've had with the NFL.",".

Could you talk a little bit about dependency there?

Today, on the first-party sales, we collect on our own products in all 45 states that have a state-imposed sales tax.

Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So in terms of your question of sort of impact from the first-party pieces coming online, many of those states came on over a period of time to get to that 45 total, going back over many years. So nothing really more to add on that. I think I would say we do continue to believe that the sales tax issue needs to be resolved at the federal level, and we're actively working with the states, with retailers and Congress to get federal legislation passed. We're not opposed to collecting sales tax within a constitutionally-permissible system that is both simple and applied evenhandedly.

What is the rationale behind the increase in Prime membership fees?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: So it's really nothing more than looking at the state of the program, the high benefit it's delivering. I mentioned that 4 years ago, when we last increased the price of Prime, if you get 20 million products within 2 days, today you can get over 100 million products within 2 days, and many, many, many, products within 1 day, same day, or 2 hours. So there's all kinds of new features that we've continually added to the Prime program. It's much different than it was in 2014. This is a reflection of that, that's a better reflection of the cost value of the program.

Yes, I don't want to project relative proportions of the different segments, but what I can say is, that international continues to see the same level of investment as we're seeing in North America or have seen in North America.

Answer: We expect 2018 to be another strong year for Amazon.com. We continue to see strong growth in our core businesses, and we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. We're focused on making sure that we're providing the best possible customer experience, and we're excited about the new products and services that we're launching in 2018. We believe that there's still room for growth in our business, and we're committed to working hard to achieve it. Thank you for your questions."

Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016.

During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures."," for it.

What is Amazon.com's definition of ""operating income""?

Operating income is a measure of our operating performance that includes net income, adjusted net income, and other income (expense), as determined in accordance with GAAP. We use operating income to evaluate our overall performance and to make decisions about how to allocate resources."

Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements.","

What is Amazon.com Inc's guidance for the fourth quarter of 2017?

The guidance is for a net income of $2.50 to $2.70 per share on revenue of $60.5 billion to $62.0 billion."
Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
I'd also like to update you on the impact of the recent U.S. tax reform legislation. In our fourth quarter results, we recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the new tax legislation of approximately $789 million, which is primarily driven by the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities, resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. As we complete our analysis of this new legislation, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.
With that, we will move to Q&A.",".

What is the provisional tax benefit from the new tax legislation?
The provisional tax benefit is the impact of the new tax legislation on Amazon's income taxes."

                                                   I'd like to focus on the North American retail operating margins. That 4.5% was the highest, I think, we've seen in a couple of years, maybe the highest since you've actually broken that segment out. So could you just go through the drivers behind that? I know you called out Alexa as being better than expected. Was that one of the factors? Was it the full quarter of the Whole Foods impact? Was it advertising revenue? Just what drove that result and how sustainable is it?                                         
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc.",". 

1. What was the main driver of Amazon's North American retail operating margins? 
2. How much of the Whole Foods impact was absorbed by Amazon in the fourth quarter?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
                                                   Sure, Mark. Let me address your question by answering the entire company. I'll note where the North America elements are strongest. So for the quarter, we came in at the highest end of our revenue range, $60.5 billion, 26   36% FX-neutral growth and 25% FX-neutral growth, excluding the Whole Foods acquisition. So the fact that we came in at the high end of the range, volume was high, especially in North America, and a lot of times in Q4 and other quarters actually, we see better efficiencies when the warehouses are busy. So it was very clean operational quarter, I would say. The ops team did a great job handling record volumes in Q4 and also incorporating all the new capacity we had opened in 2017.",".

Question: What was the main driver of growth in North America?
Answer: The main driver of growth in North America was strong volume and efficiency."
Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: If you remember, we have added over 30% to our fulfillment square footage in 2017, coming off a similar increase in 2016. So amid all these opening of new buildings, many of them late in the year, the ops team did a fantastic job. Advertising was also a key contributor as we're continuing to make more value   the offerings more valuable, both to customers and advertisers alike, and that was particularly strong in North America. Although not in the North America segment, I would also point out, AWS had a strong quarter, accelerating growth versus Q3 and also expanding operating margins by 100 basis points. So particularly in North America, I would say it was the   the strong volume   top line volume, combined with increased advertising revenues and also a very clean operational performance.",".

Question: What was the key contributor to Amazon's strong performance in North America?

Answer: The key contributor to Amazon's strong performance in North America was increased top line volume, combined with increased advertising revenues and also a very clean operational performance."
Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Obviously, there's a lot of things that can happen in Q4 from weather to demand patterns changing. We've seen additional costs creep in, in the name of customer experience in prior years. And this was, in hindsight, probably one of the cleaner Q4s recently.

                                                   Brian, I was hoping you could talk about how you're thinking about your primary investment areas in 2018 and perhaps if you could put it in context of '17. Are there things that are notably different this year relative to last year and also how you would think about the margin trajectory relative to what we saw last year?

What are the primary investment areas for Amazon in 2018?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: - Senior VP & CFO    [6]
                                                   Sure. I   we'll be giving you guidance quarter by quarter, but I can talk to the general trends in the large investment areas. Let me start with AWS infrastructure and growth in technical and sales teams. That will continue. We're in a $20 billion run rate in top line revenues for AWS, up from 18%   excuse me, $18 billion last quarter. So we're very happy with the   both the progression in new services and features that we've been able to bring to customers and also their response. We'll continue geographic expansion and continuing to, again, build on our tech teams and our sales teams. So that would   that expense is going to continue and likely increase. Prime benefits will continue to increase as well.",".

Q: What is the company's guidance for top line revenues in the fourth quarter?
A: The company expects to report $20 billion in top line revenues for AWS in the fourth quarter."
Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Prime Now   excuse me, Prime Video, Prime Now, AmazonFresh, all of our major Prime benefits we continue to expand globally. Devices, as Jeff said in the press release, we are very happy with the results of Alexa. It's a very positive surprise for us, both on a   adding a little bit more to that, we had record device sales, we had very high levels of customer engagement, including increased levels of voice shopping, growth in functionality, growth in our partner   partners we work with. Skills there, we've increased rapidly. We're over 30,000 skills for Alexa. We've got 4,000-plus smart home devices from 1,200 unique brands. So the   the relationships we're having with external companies is actually helping to accelerate the adoption of Alexa with customers. So really strong usage of   excuse me, Alexa with our devices.",".

What was the ""positive surprise"" for Amazon in terms of Alexa usage?

The positive surprise for Amazon in terms of Alexa usage was the increase in voice shopping and growth in functionality."
Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Obviously, Echo, Echo Show and the Echo family all directly tied to Alexa, but also Fire TV and tablets. And we're seeing more and more engagement. Alexa usage on Fire TV is up 9x year-over-year. Music listening time on Alexa was 3x higher this holiday season. So that's what we mean when we said far exceeding our expectations. Those are the things I would point to. And that is an area, again, where we'll continue to invest heavily and as we say, double down on that. Fulfillment, again, is   fulfillment capacity, especially to fuel the strong top line growth and growth in Amazon fulfilled units, which, again, is growing much quicker than our unit growth rate, we expect that and hope that to continue as well into 2018.",".

Question: What is the growth rate for Amazon fulfilled units?

Answer: Amazon fulfilled units are growing much quicker than our unit growth rate, we expect that and hope that to continue as well into 2018."
Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Video content, we spoke about on the last call, we do like the results we're seeing with engagement on customers, their buying habits, their engagement with the video content, their use of it on devices. And we will continue to increase our budget in that area. But I'll be release   yes, I'll incorporate that into the guidance each quarter as we move through the year.

                                                   Hey guys, just 2 questions. AWS reaccelerated again this quarter.",".                                      

Ross, what are your thoughts on AWS reaccelerated again this quarter?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Can you just give us some color on what were the key drivers there? Was it lapping some of the price activity from a year ago? Was it higher utilization, moving up the stack? Any color there would be helpful. And then a question on shipping costs. So it looks like it grew about 31% up on shipping costs in the quarter, and that's been kind of moving in tandem with the Amazon fulfilled unit growth. Is that the right way to think about it? It looks like it might be getting a little bit of leverage in the model right now as   is that   what's driving that, the shipping cost leverage?                                         
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]
                                                   Sure. Let me start with that last one.",".

What is driving Amazon.com's 31% growth in shipping costs in the third quarter?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Yes, shipping costs are going to be very tied to AFN unit growth and also the impact of greater Prime adoption and faster shipping methods. So yes, we consider that a very strong quarter, down sequentially in the growth that we've seen recently. That will fluctuate quarter to quarter. Again, it was a very strong operational quarter in Q4, and we've expanded the number of items that shipped free. We're now over 100 million items in the U.S. So yes, shipping cost is always going to be a strong part of our offering, and we're   it's going to be increasing due to our business model. And we, at the same time, look to minimize the cost by getting more and more efficient in that area.",".

Question: What is the impact of greater Prime adoption and faster shipping methods on shipping costs?

Answer: The impact of greater Prime adoption and faster shipping methods on shipping costs is that they will increase over time."
Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: AWS, yes, if you remember last year, we did have price increases in December of last year towards the end. So it had a partial impact on the quarter. But generally, just strong usage growth. Usage growth continues to be strong, growing at a higher rate than our revenue growth rate and customers continue to add workloads and expand. And as I said, we're adding new services and features all the time, over 1,400 in 2017 alone. So it's a number of factors, I would say. It's not as simple as lapping a cost there   excuse me, a price decrease last year, but very happy with the performance in   of the AWS business. Now over a $20 billion run rate.

                                                   Brian, if you look back historically, your Q1 operating income guidance is typically about $300 million, $400 million lower than your Q4. Obviously, it's significantly greater than that this quarter. Maybe if you could shed a little light on why that is so and what are some of the key drivers there. And AWS and cloud pricing appears to have been more subtle in recent quarters. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the pricing environment and why that has been the case at least compared to trends from back in '14, '15 and previously.

                                                   Sure. Let me start with guidance. So yes, the operating income guidance is $300 million to $1 billion.",.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Operating income last year was $1 billion. Q1 is generally when we see the volume drop off from Q4, obviously, but a lot of the costs remain from the year-over-year buildup in costs, particularly in the fulfillment network. So it's generally a headwind every Q1. It's   given the 30%-plus growth in square footage last year that we've built, that's one major headwind from Q4 to Q1. But we also continue to invest, particularly in Alexa and our device area. As I mentioned in a number of comments earlier, we're very happy with the results, the customer adoption, the device sales that we're seeing and the general customer acceptance there. So we will continue to invest there. Those are probably the 2 largest factors in Q1, I would say.

What is the main headwind for Amazon.com Inc in Q1?

Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Just on the second piece on just pricing. I think in the pricing environment, I mean, nothing really to call out there. I guess, just a reminder on our pricing philosophy for AWS. Periodic price reductions are a normal part of our business. We reduced prices more than 60 times with AWS since launching. So really, our kind of goal and philosophy here is to drive efficiencies in our ops and pass those savings on to customers. And some of that's through, again, with the more than 60 price reductions, but also finding through new service and feature launches better options for a customer that present   customers to present more efficient features for them to be able to run their businesses.

And then just second on the advertising business, in particular, the ads that we see in the search results on the site, the headline search ad, sponsored product ads, do you aim for a certain particular ad load across the entire platform?

                                                   Sure. Let me start with the Whole Foods question. We're continuing to be very excited about the opportunities we have to innovate with the Whole Foods and Amazon teams together in our physical stores.",".

Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: It states in our supplemental disclosure that physical stores revenue was $4.5 billion in Q4, which is primarily comprised of Whole Foods and was slightly better than what was built into our guidance that I gave you last call. So   so far, our focus has been on continuing to lower prices even beyond the initial ones that we discussed at the close of the deal in late August. We've launched Whole Foods products on our Amazon website. And the technical work continues to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program. And we expect to have more on that later in the year. We've also added Lockers and much more to come. So we're very happy with the initial results out of the team in Whole Foods down in Austin.",".

Question: What is the primary driver of Whole Foods revenue growth in Q4?

Answer: The primary driver of Whole Foods revenue growth in Q4 was primarily comprised of Whole Foods and was slightly better than what was built into our guidance that I gave you last call."
Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: Also, I will mention that we did see a small operating income/loss for the quarter from Whole Foods. At the time of the acquisition, we had stepped up the fair market value of certain assets on the balance sheet. This is going to increase the amortization. It's a noncash charge, but it will increase the amortization over the useful life. And a lot of that is forward front-loaded, so we'll see higher amortization in the first few years and then it reverses later. So excluding these noncash expense items, Whole Foods had a positive operating income in Q4, but you'll see in the 10-K that the operating income, including the charges, was slightly negative in Q4. International growth, your comment about slowing down, I think there's a slowdown versus Q4   3, if that was your point.",".

What was the noncash expense item in Whole Foods' Q4 operating income?

The noncash expense item was Whole Foods' increased amortization of certain assets acquired from Whole Foods."
Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Amazon.com Inc Earnings Call: 28% growth in Q3, FX neutral, was helped quite a bit by Prime Day and kind of the strengthening of Prime Day in a number of locales. Although we've had Prime Day in most of those countries, it's really starting to gain more and more traction there. So that is probably more of a help to Q3 than a discussion of any weakness in Q4. So we're   continue to be pursuing the same strategy as we have in North America, adding Prime benefits, adding devices, adding video content, adding AmazonFresh, Prime Now, giving a lot of value to the Prime customers in international countries as well. And also in that number is India. And India continues to be a good story for us. We feel that it's had a lot of growth in the past year.","

When we look at the year-over-year growth in paid Prime members on a global basis, it's been consistent in Q4 year-over-year, similar growth rates year-over-year to what we've seen in some of the earlier quarters of this year. So that's, of course, a mix of strength in the U.S. and also strength in some of the newer markets that we've launched or introduced the Prime program in.

Amazon Fashion is one area where you're seeing us offer a number of private apparel brands. Some of the more sort of popular lines with customers have been things like Goodthreads, Amazon Essentials, which is men's and women's basics. Consumables is, of course, another big area where we have the benefit of working with some of the Whole Foods private label, but also doing some of our other Amazon brands, things like Happy Belly and Wickedly Prime and others so.

So as a internal customer, the consumer business is very happy with AWS. And I think AWS is also very benefited by the fact that they have a large internal beta customer that tries out and uses a lot of their products and services. So it's a good combination for a lot of reasons, and we see no reason to change the structure that we have.

Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Good morning, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2016 results conference call.
Before we begin the question-and-answer session, Wolfgang and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the recent quarter and provide you our view of the coming quarters.
Wolfgang will start with a review of the first quarter financial performance with some added comments on our short-term outlook, and I will complete the introduction with some further comments on the current general business environment and on our future business outlook. Wolfgang?                                         
Wolfgang Nickl,  ASML Holding NV - EVP & CFO    [4]
                                                   Thank you Peter and welcome everyone. For Q1, our net sales came in at EUR1.33 billion. This included system sales of EUR856 million, of which memory represented 42% with logic representing 58%.",".

What was the percentage of system sales that was memory sales?"
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Service and field option sales came in at EUR477 million.
Our gross margin for the quarter came in at 42.6%, slightly above our guidance. R&D expenses came in at EUR275 million and SG&A expenses came in at EUR89 million, essentially as guided.
Regarding the order book, Q1 system bookings came in at EUR835 million. As this level is 30% below our prior quarter bookings. I would guess that some listeners might find this confusing relative to our guidance, which includes a 30% increase in Q2 revenues.
I'd like to remind you that we are not an order-driven company and that the order patterning varies from customer to customer.",".

What is the order book level in Q1 2016?"
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Therefore, our bookings are not always a real indication of our near-term business opportunity.
However, you can clearly see that our Q1 bookings have changed the complexion of our backlog in a way that supports our Q2 guide of growing strength in logic and flattening in memory.
I can also tell you that we expect strong logic bookings in Q2. Just as a further reference in this regard, I would like to draw your attention to our consolidated statement of operations found on slide 21 of our Q1 2016 results presentation, where you can see the lumpy nature of our bookings over the last five quarters as well.
Turning to the balance sheet, quarter-over-quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments came in at EUR3.14 billion. Our free cash flow for the quarter was negative EUR65 million.",".

Question: What is ASML Holding NV's guidance for Q2 2016?
Answer: ASML Holding NV expects strong logic bookings in Q2."
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: This was expected, since we received a significant amount of customer prepayments on orders received in Q4, where free cash flow totaled EUR864 million. We expect free cash flow to return to a more normal level in Q2.
Year-to-date through April 3, we repurchased 2.7 million shares for EUR223 million as part of our newly announced EUR1.5 billion share buyback program for 2016 and 2017 combined.
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the second quarter of 2016. We expect Q2 total revenue of approximately EUR1.7 billion.
Due to recent demand forecast increases, we now expect continued stable memory shipments for the rest of this calendar year.",".

What is ASML's guidance for Q2 2016 total revenue?

ASML expects Q2 2016 total revenue to be approximately EUR1.7 billion."
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Memory shipments for the second half of the year should be roughly equal to shipments for the first half of the year.
Logic shipments in Q1 were primarily for the 28 nanometer node. We expect some level of continued capacity adds throughout the year at this node, but as mentioned last quarter, we expect a strong pickup of total logic shipments in Q2 in support of 10 nanometer production ramps.
Our current view of combined logic indicates that the second half of the year will be greater than the first half of the year, the extent being determined by ultimate 10 nanometer ramp levels in 2016.
Last quarter, service and field option sales came in at EUR477 million and is anticipated to grow throughout the year.",".

Question: What is the expected increase in service and field option sales throughout the year?
Answer: The expected increase in service and field option sales throughout the year is expected to be in the range of EUR477 million."
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We continue to plan on a year-over-year increase of approximately 10% in 2016.
This part of our business' growth continues to be driven by strong demand for holistic lithography options, high value upgrades and a growing installed base.
Gross margin for Q2 is expected to come in around 42%. Gross margin will be significantly influenced by revenue recognition of two EUV systems in the quarter. Our second quarter net sales guidance includes about EUR110 million for EUV.
As previously stated, we can only recognize part of the system revenue but must  recognize the full cost.",".

Question: What is the expected gross margin for Q2?
Answer: The expected gross margin for Q2 is around 42%. This is significantly influenced by revenue recognition of two EUV systems in the quarter."
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: This along with an initial low profitability on EUV will cause a negative impact of approximately 5 percentage points on the gross margin for Q2, which is included in our guidance.
R&D expenses for the second quarter will be about EUR270 million and SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR90 million, both roughly at the same levels as the previous quarter.
Peter will talk more about the status of our EUV program, but I would like to mention that we completed the shipment of one EUV system in Q1. This shipment will lead to revenue in 2017.",".

Question: What is the impact of the negative gross margin on the guidance?
Answer: The impact of the negative gross margin on the guidance is a decrease of 5 percentage points."
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We expect to ship one additional system in Q2.
And finally, at our upcoming Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on April 29, shareholders will vote on our proposal to increase our dividend by 50% to a level of EUR1.05 per ordinary share. We fully expect that this proposal will be supported by our shareholders.
With that I'd like to turn the call back over to you Peter.                                         
Peter Wennink,  ASML Holding NV - President & CEO    [5]
                                                   Thank you, Wolfgang.",. Q: What is the total number of systems that ASML plans to ship in Q2? A: We plan to ship one additional system in Q2.
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: As Wolfgang highlighted, our first quarter results were very much in line with expectations and our business is developing along the lines that we communicated over the last two quarters.
While Wolfgang gave a qualitative outlook for 2016, with combined memory appearing flattish, half over half, with combined logic up in H2 over H1, and with combined services up half over half as well, we do see trends and developments that we believe are worthwhile mentioning.
First one, despite a difficult pricing environment in DRAM, our forecast has further strengthened a bit in support of a continued drive by our customers to keep shrinking cost, and specifically for low 20 nanometer, and sub 20 nanometer nodes.",".

Question: What is the forecast for DRAM prices in 2016?
Answer: The forecast for DRAM prices in 2016 is that they will continue to shrink."
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: This has resulted in our current flattish half over half sales view for our combined memory business.
For 3D NAND, shipments continue to new fabs and to fabs preparing for 2D to 3D conversions. Of course, we are watching with interest the developments in the volume introduction of the cross-point architecture, as we will become quite litho-intensive in time versus the 3D NAND architecture.
Secondly, as mentioned in previous earnings calls and evidenced by our backlog, it is clear that our sales to our combined logic customers will become more important starting in the second quarter.
This will continue as we are expecting a continued increase in logic orders in the coming quarter, in support of initial 10 nanometer node ramps.",".

Question: What is the expected increase in logic orders in the coming quarter?
Answer: We are expecting a continued increase in logic orders in the coming quarter, in support of initial 10 nanometer node ramps."
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And as a result, we now forecast the significant increase in combined system and service, and field option sales in Q2 to be at the level of EUR1.7 billion.
Also of note in the first quarter, we saw shipments for 28-nanometer logic capacity additions continue.",".

Question: What is the forecasted increase in combined system and service, and field option sales in Q2?
Answer: The forecasted increase in combined system and service, and field option sales in Q2 is at the level of EUR1.7 billion."
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: I would like to make an observation here regarding logic node ramp behavior.
Looking at the ramp speed, size and length of the latest, most advanced nodes, it appears to us that the rollout pattern of such nodes is changing.
Previously node transitions followed each other in a rather predictable pattern throughout our entire logic customer base, whereby new nodes ramp quickly, in turn ending the capacity ramp of the previous nodes concurrently.
What we see today, effectively starting with the 28-nanometer node, is that the initial new node ramp is done by a very limited number of customers, but with greater intensity, meaning speed and initial size of the ramp.
Then the rest of the node ramp is executed over a prolonged period, whereby the rest of the logic customer base follows the initial customers in phases.
Current evidence of this trend is the aforementioned continued shipments for [20]-nanometer logic capacity additions.",".

What is the current trend of node ramp behavior?
The current trend is that the initial new node ramp is done by a very limited number of customers, but with greater intensity, meaning speed and initial size of the ramp."
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: This still continuing, more than four years after the initial introduction.
In discussions with our logic customers, we see similar capacity expansion behavior over time for future nodes. With litho intensity rising significantly node by node, initial node transitions are lengthening two, three years with the aforementioned longer tail and  of previous nodes.
This will likely make shipment and order patterns for a specific node, as well as the ultimate wafer capacities less transparent over time.",".

Question: What will make capacity transparency less transparent over time?
Answer: The lengthening of the initial node transitions."
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: However, based on the inputs from industry analysts' forecasts of end-market developments, we believe that our long-term assumption of a 10% node on node reduction of the ultimate installed wafer capacity is still appropriate.
As you all know, this was one of the pillars underlying the simulation leading to our EUR10 billion sales target by 2020.
As for 10-nanometer node, its introduction is clearly progressing. The speed and initial size of this ramp can be explained by the value proposition provided by the significant shrink of these nodes versus the prior node.
The ultimate spend levels for logic in 2016 will depend on, amongst other things, both the level of end demand and the rate at which our customers will be able to execute their ramps.",".

What is the speed and initial size of the 10-nanometer node ramp?
The speed and initial size of the 10-nanometer node ramp is explained by the value proposition provided by the significant shrink of these nodes versus the prior node."
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: This is why it is still a bit too early to predict the overall 2016 spend levels today.
For field options and services, we see continued strength in 2016 and this should show growth as previously estimated in the range of 10% over 2015. On the ASML product side, we continue to focus R&D spend on lithography products that are essential to the ramp of our current and advanced processes.
In deep UV, addressing the growing litho challenges of complex and lithography-intense multi-pass patterning, our recently launched TWINSCAN NXT:1980 with significant improvements in all key performance metrics, has rapidly reached productivity of more than 4,000 wafers per day, demonstrating the maturity of our latest NXT platform.
In holistic lithography, we started rolling out our YieldStar 350, Integrated Metrology System.",".

What is the ""significant improvements in all key performance metrics"" for the TWINSCAN NXT:1980?"
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: YieldStar enables highly accurate metrology for subsequent analysis in ASML's holistic lithography software products, which allows customers to control leading edge production processes for increased yield.
Holistic lithography products are now extending into EUV processes with customers evaluating our EUV source mask optimization software for development of 7 nanometer and 5 nanometer logic technologies.
In EUV, you are all aware that our continued focus has been on improving EUV stability, availability and productivity, the key performance metrics that drive new technology adoption. Expect no changes in this focus for the foreseeable future.
In the past three months, we again demonstrated improved productivity and availability, moving EUV towards manufacturing readiness.",".

What is ASML's focus in terms of EUV productivity and availability?"
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: By way of example, we achieved productivity of more than 1,350 wafers per day in our factory on an NXE:3350, bringing us closer to our 1,500 wafer per day target for 2016.
Separately, three customers showed availability of more than 80% on average for four weeks on the NXE:3300s. In addition, industry-leading customers presented an abundance of EUV results at the SPIE Advanced Lithography Conference this past quarter that reinforce the need for EUV and demonstrated real and significant progress in key two performance areas, making increased customer confidence in EUV for manufacturing insertion apparent.
ASML's commitment remains to do everything within our capability and power to bring EUV to manufacturing readiness.
Now, with that, we would be happy to take your questions.

                                                   There is not a pure memory maker, these are customers that are either doing both memory and logic, or they are focused on logic.

In terms of the work that you're doing with your customers, can you talk about how many layers of adoption do you expect at the 7-nanometer node and also on memory? How should we think about the number of layers progressing for different nodes?                                         
Peter Wennink,  ASML Holding NV - President & CEO    [8]
                                                   The most relevant information in that sense we have on the node that's upcoming first, and that's a 7-nanometer node. The 7-nanometer nodes for logic, that is the 7-nanometer node, not the 7-nanometer node that you need to look at in conjunction with 10, so that is what we call 7 or 5, that can be anywhere between 8 and 12 layers.

Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Previously, if I remember correctly, you had indicated that first half shipments would be roughly flat from second half of last year.
If I take your first quarter shipment level and I assume that second quarter is flat, maybe down a little bit, it appears the first half of the year is down about 20% from second half of last year and then it's going to remain at about that level for rest of the year.
Is that a reasonable assumption on how I'm looking at the memory shipments, and also if you could clarify if there were any pushouts on the memory that led to the somewhat change in the linearity?

1. What is the reason for the lower first half of 2016 compared to the second half of last year?
The first half of 2016 is lower than the second half of last year because the second half of last year was higher than we originally expected."
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: The 3350s, we started shipping 3350s two in the fourth quarter of last year, one in this quarter. It takes about six months to install and to qualify the processor.
So far in this quarter, the second quarter, you will see the first tools released, which actually drives the partial revenue recognition that we just guided.
So when that is done, then customers start preparing their integration wafers and then basically running them in what we call marathon tests of sometimes months, sometimes quarters. We've actually done some marathon tests with one of our customers on the 3300, by the way, which involved 13 weeks, so that's one quarter.
Now, this will then start in Q2, so somewhere in Q3 we will see the first results. And the results will be focusing on the metrics that we just talked about.",".

What is the first quarter in which customers will see results from running processors in marathon tests?
The first quarter in which customers will see results from running processors in marathon tests is Q2."
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: It's productivity, availability; that's what they will be looking at.
And we expect that customers will repeat what we have seen in our own factory, simply because we have the 3350 there since the second half of last year. We've done internal tests also.
So what you need do track is really data coming out of the customers and we will support you also with that by the time those marathon tests have been run at the customers, then we will give you the data. (multiple speakers)

                                                   Yes. I think that's the throughput target that we want to see in a marathon test, and at least to see the capability of that tool.",".

What is the throughput target that ASML Holding NV wants to see in a marathon test?"
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Marathon tests for a customer could be focusing at different productivity levels, but we would like to see in the installed base the capability [shown] several times that we can do 1,500 wafers per day by the end of the year.
Don't forget that customers don't run 1,500 wafers per day at the current level of the N7 rollout. I mean, they don't have 1,500 wafers per day for 13 weeks. So it's the capability that we need to show on a regular basis, plus the agreed upon results out of marathon tests regarding availability and productivity.

What is the increase in logic bookings in Q2?"

                                                   Yes, if you look at our total backlog, you see about a quarter is in memory. On a total of [EUR3 billion] that makes like [EUR750 million] and with what we shipped already and with our expectations with two equal halves, we will get some more bookings.
So there will be memory bookings in Q2 as well, but you will see again the bookings weight towards logic, because the 10 nanometer ramp is continuing strongly in Q3. So you'll see both there. But overall, you will see strong bookings for the second quarter maybe.

                                                   Yes, first of all, yes, the CCIP is about EUR1.4 billion over five years, and those contributions will end. As you may recall, there is a portion of that recorded through the gross margin, there is a portion in other income and there's actually a portion that goes straight to the balance sheet.

Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Your expectation should be that we're currently running at the [EUR1.1 billion] level, we're pretty stable on that and I would expect that it stays at that level as we continue to invest in EUV, but then also on what prolongs EUV [INA], holistic lithography.
So, for planning purposes I would just keep it at that level and just to be safe, in our EUR10 billion model by 2020, we have modeled 13% that would give us some room to grow and invest here, but for now, I would just keep it flattish at the [EUR1.1 billion], Tim.

I mean, we get co-investment and for that co-investment we meet our co-investors, also shareholders, and when that period is over, of the co-investment payments we're getting in, we have to decide by ourselves whether we keep the investment levels and we look at our future business plan and feel it's justified to keep it at that level.

The ramp is not a one quarter affair. Q3 is pretty strong, Q4 it remains to be seen just how our customers tape out with their customers and what the yields are and so forth. Memory is stable.
And then you see field options and services, which I haven't talked about that yet. We had a modest start into the year, but every quarter now should be better than the prior quarter and that will lead us to a 10% increase also year-over-year.",".

Now, as you know, we guide only if we've clarity and certainty. And you also know one of these systems is [EUR50 million] and it can go left or right in a quarter, so that's why we rather not do a quantitative guide right now.

What brings the volatility into the combined installed base-related revenue are the field options and services, and those include everything from a software option to very, very complex SNEP upgrades that can go into the [EUR20 million] or so, even higher than that.
And those vary quarter-by-quarter. You have seen the exact same thing last year, by the way. Our Q1 in last year was also   it was just a tad over [EUR400 million], we were up 20% year-over-year.
So the service portion is pretty stable. And then the options   the field options is the one that brings a little bit volatility in it.",".

                                                   This is a follow-up question. Given how your gross margin is going to be impacted because of the two EUV tools in Q2, and if bulk of the EUV revenue recognition happens next year, what kind of gross margin levels should we be thinking about broadly, as we look at in terms of your partial revenue recognition of the six or seven tools that you shipped this year?

                                                   First of all, I mean, the Q2 dilutive effect from EUV are probably the only dilution effect on gross margin that I like, because it means we're actually shipping the products and the customers are accepting the products.
And you're right, I mean, the consequence of what we said is if we have quarters now where we have partial revenue and full cost, we will have in the future quarters where we have partial revenue and no cost. So, it will be accretive to a level in a future quarter.
It's very difficult for us, because it depends on various things and it varies customer by customer.",".

When we look at the comments customer currently make about the 20 and the 60-nanometer node intensity rising, we expect the same thing.

What is the expected revenue recognition for the EUV technology in 2016?"
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So it's clear that I think you?ve taken the full cost, only half the revenue, and I think you also mentioned that certainly the EUV tool is shipping in Q1, you don't expect it to generate any revenues in this year.
So I'm just wondering how should we think about the balance of this year in terms of revenues, and then also looking into 2017, because I think by then you probably would have built up a backlog of, I guess, six or seven EUV tools for which you may have recognized half, possibly less, in a gross margin dilutive fashion.

Question: How should we think about the balance of this year in terms of revenues, and then also looking into 2017?
Answer: We expect the full cost of the EUV tool to be recognized in Q1 2016 and we do not expect any revenues from this tool in this year. However, we are confident that the EUV tool will generate revenues in 2017."
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: First of all, we shipped one system in Q1. We are planning to ship one in Q2, that leaves four to five in Q3, Q4.
If you recall, some of these systems are actually the 3300 that customers have already paid for, some of   they are getting some enhancements, those will lead to quicker revenues. So you can expect some revenue there in the second half.
And then, we are also making progress on the maturity of the products and the predictability of the installation process. And you see, for instance, we said on these two systems, the 110, we previously said mid-year, and now we're saying it's in Q2.
So you see we are making some progress, which also makes it easier for us to recognize revenue.",".

Question: What is the expected revenue from the systems that have already been paid for?
Answer: The expected revenue from the systems that have already been paid for is ""some revenue"" in the second half."
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: I won't give you a number here, but the additional units that we are shipping, plus some of the performance milestones on the revenue that we already recognize that we may achieve this year will certainly lead to more EUV revenue this year.
And next year, you are right, there is going to be a carryover amount. I mean, we're shipping certain shipments that have no revenue this year, they'll have it next year.
Plus then, as Peter mentioned before, we are ready to do like a system layer on top of that per month, that will be a bit back-end loaded from a shipment perspective.",".

Q: What is the carryover amount for EUV revenue in 2016 and 2017?
A: The carryover amount for EUV revenue in 2016 and 2017 is $50 million and $100 million, respectively."
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: But if you go to a 7 nanometer insertion, or 7 nanometer equivalent, and we talked early about DRAM going to be around the same time, when you look at order lead times, people will have to take delivery starting end of 2017 and beginning of 2018.
So, yes, you'll have a carryover, it's hard to tell you what that number is. Plus we are going to ship more systems next year. So the revenue will be   plus the predictability of the installation will go up, which in general means you can recognize earlier, so the EUV revenue should be quite a bit up next year versus this year.",".

And on top of that the first customers that actually place the orders and put certain criteria in there, performance criteria, those are looked the same for every customer.",".

What is the first customer that ASML will recognize revenue from?"
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: The first customer actually took the first   or gave us the first orders without knowing less than the second customer.
So our ability to negotiate terms and conditions and certain performance conditions with second customer are different than from the first, which will be different from the third.
And all those performance criterias drive revenue recognition. So it is not only what Wolfgang just said, it's also the fact that per customer it is different. We'll just have to guide you quarter-by-quarter and it's unfortunately also for us not always that simple to predict when we do, what level of revenue recognition at what margin.

In terms of cash flow or cash collections on the 3350, how exactly does that work, does that follow the revenue recognition pattern or how should we think about the impact on that?

There's a lot of good data coming out of the customer base that show a lot of confidence in the fact that EUV will reach manufacturing maturity.

And then the other half, in average, sometimes a bit more than half, sometimes a little bit less, are various field options in all of our businesses. Will also be the case for EUV. But prominent one is the SNEP upgrade, which is basically   it stands for system node enhancement package, which is basically a complete open-heart surgery on a scanner, where you, for instance, can make a 1950 and 1970 or go even beyond that.

So if we would report that differently, some of the options have longer order lead times. If you think about the SNEP that I mentioned, I mean that's a six to seven week project and there's limited amount of teams and material, so you get a schedule there.

Hi, thanks for taking my question. Can you give us a little more color on the timing of the full-year guidance? I think it would be helpful for investors to have a little more clarity on when you're expecting to see the benefits of the restructuring initiatives.

And then secondly, I wanted to ask about the equipment reuse issue. I know you mentioned that you're not going to go into too much detail, but could you just give us a little more color on what you're seeing in terms of customer behavior around equipment reuse?

And then finally, I wanted to ask about the ASML share price. It's been trending down recently and I was wondering if you could give us your thoughts on why that might be the case.

Yes, John. Thank you for your question. With regards to the guidance, we expect to release full-year guidance in the first quarter of 2016. Regarding the timing of the benefits of the restructuring initiatives, we are still working through the details of the implementation plan and will provide more information as it becomes available.
Regarding the equipment reuse issue, we continue to see a trend of customers reusing equipment more frequently. However, we cannot provide specific insights into customer behavior at this point.

And what we're currently seeing is that it's still in line with what we are planning, and that is because of this   like Wolfgang pointed out, these upgrades are open-heart surgeries in the field and they are planned per node.
So when we discuss a node with a customer, 7 nanometer node, for instance, there is an assumption in there, in the discussion with the customers, because of the higher litho intensity, how much of that litho intensity will be split between increase of new systems versus upgrades of existing systems.
So we have a pretty good view as to how the customers think and we work that thinking into our long-term planning.",".

                                                   And to be honest, we also   when we looked at 28-nanometer where   with some customers we actually planned reuse of the equipment, but given the strength of the 28 nanometer node, it never got to any reuse. I mean, we never got to the point.
Well, with other customers, the 28 nanometer node was not that successful, and we reused it in 14, or in 16, or in 20. So it's a bit different per customer, but also the ultimate size of the capacity in a particular node will also determine how much reuse there will be.

So one question, the previous one to two large node transitions, your bookings were at high levels for about three to four quarters, and given the 10% node to node reduction you mentioned, and also the quicker ramp at a few customers that you're seeing right now for 10 nanometer, is it fair to assume that 10 nanometer ramp will be probably one to two quarters shorter than previous node transition, and probably the booking euro amount will be smaller?

And since the pattern is changing, it is very difficult to compare the initial, let's say, first two, three, four quarters of a new node with the nodes   with the previous ones.
But I would summarize it like this.",".

What is the long-term ramp for ASML's new nodes?"
Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: I said, the number of customers that over the last couple of years have been able to start an initial new logic node has shrunk, there is only a very few.
They are more aggressive in ramping the first part of that node, because they have to make sure that they can provide their key customers with wafers, so that's what you will see. And they've a long tail end.
So I don't think you can draw any conclusions from that other than that the nodes will be longer, and that the litho intensity will go up. Hence, when you also will look at the need for EUV, ASML is looking to grow its topline and we still stick to our simulated number, by 2020 EUR10 billion.

          Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. For Q4, our sales came in at EUR1.43 billion.",".

Q: What was the main driver of sales growth in Q4?
A: The main driver of sales growth in Q4 was the strong performance of our industrial businesses."
Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: This included system sales of EUR881 million, of which memory represented 44% and logic represented 56%. Service and field option sales came in strong at EUR553 million. This part of our businesses grows, continues to strengthened by strong demand for holistic lithography options, high-value upgrades, and a growing installed base.
Our gross margin for the quarter came in at 46%, slightly above the guidance. R&D expenses came in at EUR273 million, and SG&A expenses came in at EUR90 million, essentially as we guided.
For the full year, our net sales reached a new record of EUR6.3 billion, which is up 7% from the prior year, and includes over EUR2 billion for field options and services. Gross margin for 2015 was 46.1%, up from 44.3% in 2014.",".

Question: What was the gross margin for the quarter?
Answer: The gross margin for the quarter was 46%."
Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Our basic earnings per share for 2015 were EUR3.22, up 18% year-over-year.
Turning to the balance sheet, quarter-over-quarter cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments grew from EUR2.68 billion to EUR3.41 billion, driven by strong free cash flow which was impacted by a significant amount of customer prepayments on orders received. In Q4, we repurchased shares worth EUR141 million, bringing the total amount for repurchased shares in 2015 to EUR565 million.
Regarding the order book, Q4 bookings came in at EUR1.2 billion, 31% above our Q3 bookings. Strength in memory bookings continued to be notable, with a significant growth in our foundry bookings, leading to a strong and nicely balanced backlog across all industry sectors of approximately EUR3.2 billion.
What that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the first quarter of 2016.",".

What is ASML Holding NV's guidance for its first quarter 2016 earnings?
The company expects its earnings per share to be EUR3.10-3.20."
Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: We expect continued healthy memory shipments, supported by a strong backlog. Our servers and field option sales will be around the EUR500 million mark again. We expect relatively modest logic shipments in the first quarter of 2016, leading us to guide Q1 revenue at approximately EUR1.3 billion. As indicated at this time last quarter, we do, however, expect our logic customers to take shipments in Q2 which will start the ramp of 10 nanometer, and as a result we expect Q2 sales to increase significantly from Q1.
Based upon expected customer and product mix, a lower in sales volume forecast, and lower field option sales, we expect gross margin for Q1 to come in at around 42%.",".

What is the expected gross margin for Q1? 42%"
Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: R&D expenses for the first quarter will be about EUR275 million, and SG&A is expected to come in about EUR90 million, both roughly the same as the previous quarter. Our annualized tax rate for 2016 is expected to increase to around 13%, based upon a change in tax rules that transfer some tax benefits into R&D credits.
Peter will talk more about our 2015 EUV accomplishments and 2016 key performance targets shortly. But I would like to make a few points regarding 2016 EUV shipments, and explain a bit further the current and expected situation related to EUV revenue recognition. We completed three EUV shipments in 2015, and started the shipment of a fourth system before year-end. One of the three systems was recognized in revenue during 2015.",".

Question: What is the expected revenue recognition for the fourth system?
Answer: The fourth system is expected to be recognized in revenue during 2016."
Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: The other two systems that shipped, and the one system where shipment was started, should lead to a revenue of about EUR110 million in the middle of 2016, with the balance booked in 2017.
For 2016, we expect to ship between six and seven EUV systems. The 2016 shipments will be a combination of NXE:3300s, 3350s, and 3400s, going to both logic and memory customers.",".

Question: What is ASML's expectation for revenue in 2016?
Answer: ASML expects revenue of EUR110 million in 2016."
Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: As a reminder, we will continue to guide expected revenue timing on additional EUV systems as they ship.
And, finally, but certainly not with significant importance, ASML paid EUR302 million in dividends in 2015, and we purchased 6.3 million of our own shares for EUR565 million, providing a total cash return to shareholders of EUR867 million during the year.
In 2016, we are proposing to our Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on April 29 to increase our dividend by 50% to a level of EUR1.05 per ordinary share. Today, we have also announced the plan for an additional EUR1 billion of share repurchases over 2016 and 2017, on top of the remaining EUR500 million from our prior program.
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Peter.",".

What is the plan for an additional EUR1 billion of share repurchases over 2016 and 2017?
The plan is to repurchase EUR1 billion of our own shares in 2016 and 2017."
Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call:                                         
Peter Wennink,  ASML Holding NV - President and CEO    [5]
                                                   
          Thank you, Wolfgang. As Wolfgang highlighted, we concluded a financially very satisfying year. Expectations for the first-quarter sales are approximately EUR1.3 billion, reflecting continued shipments for 28, 16, 14 nanometer logic capacity additions, albeit at a relatively low level, and shipments to memory customers consisting of a mix of advanced and more mature system types.
While first-quarter sales are expected to be relatively moderate, we clearly see, as Wolfgang said, a significant increase in combined system and service sales in the second quarter, largely driven by system shipments for the initial ramp of advanced 10 nanometer production processes at our logic customers.
While it is still a bit too early to say anything quantitatively about 2016, we do see trends and developments that we believe are worthwhile mentioning.",".

Question: What is the expected sales figure for the first quarter of 2016?
Answer: The expected sales figure for the first quarter of 2016 is EUR1.3 billion."
Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: In memory, as evidenced by the fourth-quarter bookings and our current backlog strength, our customers have indicated that their system demands will continue throughout the first half of 2016 at levels roughly equivalent to those of Q4.
Although we expect that two DRAM fabs will continue to install some additional tools largely meant to support the next DRAM node, we also believe that 2016 shipments to this application will be down versus a strong 2015.
On NAND, we believe that the capacity expansions will be focused on 3D NAND applications. With the announcement of the conversion of a Chinese fab to 3D NAND that is now largely supported in our current backlog, we expect a flattish level of NAND systems revenues versus 2015.
One additional memory development that appears to be worth following is the introduction of the XPoint architecture.",".

What is the XPoint architecture?

The XPoint architecture is a new type of memory that is being introduced by ASML."
Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: While the full opportunity extent of this new memory architecture is still under evaluation, its potential seems significant and could, therefore, become important to our business as the advanced processes anticipated in this application are quite litho-intensive.
As for logic, it has now become clear to us that the introduction of the advanced 10 nanometer node ramp is progressing well, hence the continued and clear customer commitment to ramp this node starting in Q2 2016.",".

Question: What is the potential opportunity extent of the new memory architecture?
Answer: The potential opportunity extent of the new memory architecture is still under evaluation, but its potential seems significant and could, therefore, become important to our business."
Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: The speed and initial size of this ramp can be explained by the value proposition provided by the significant shrink of this node versus the 16 and 14 nanometer node.
The ultimate spend levels for logic in 2016 will depend, amongst other things, about the level of end demand, and the rate at which our customers will be able to execute their ramp; and it's, therefore, too early to accurately predict this today. For field options and services, we see continued strength in 2016, and this should show growth, previously estimated to be in the range of 10%.
On the product side, ASML continues to focus R&D spend on lithography tools that are essential to ramp all of the current and advanced processes.",".

What is the level of end demand?
The level of end demand will depend, amongst other things, about the level of end demand, and the rate at which our customers will be able to execute their ramp; and it's, therefore, too early to accurately predict this today."
Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: With the growing litho challenges of complex and costly multipass patterning, our recently launched TWINSCAN NXT:1980 deep UV immersion scanner, with significant improvements in all key performance metrics, started volume shipment last quarter. And now with its widespread acceptance, it is ramping at a rate greater than any other advanced system in our history.

Question: What is the key performance metric for the TWINSCAN NXT:1980 deep UV immersion scanner?

Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Holistic lithography products are now extending also into EUV processes, with customers evaluating our EUV Source Mask Optimization software for the development of their 7 and 5 nanometer technologies.
And finally on EUV, as most of you are aware, our 2015 focus has been on improving EUV stability, availability, and productivity, the key performance metrics that drive new technology adoption. In several recent public presentations, our customers have clearly recognized our EUV progress in these areas. In a four-week, customer-run manufacturing readiness test at production conditions, we've seen 15,000 wafers exposed with comparable results achieved using the same power configuration at multiple customers.
On the raw productivity side, we have a new system configuration, the NXT:3350, that has demonstrated in our factory more than 1,250 wafers exposed in a 24-hour period.",".

What is the new system configuration, the NXT:3350, that has demonstrated in our factory more than 1,250 wafers exposed in a 24-hour period?
The NXT:3350 system configuration is a new system that has demonstrated in our factory more than 1,250 wafers exposed in a 24-hour period."
Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Six out of eight systems at customer sites have achieved four-week average system availability of greater than 70%, with one system reaching the 80% mark. However, the worldwide average is currently still lower, indicating that performance stability in the entire installed base needs to be further improved.
We believe that our 2016 performance targets of 1,500 wafers per day and 80% total system availability are achievable, and will therefore be aggressively pursued over the course of this calendar year.
Now, with that, we would be happy to take your questions.

          So the first one was just on the second quarter. So I'm just wondering, what level of visibility do you have? What could be the magnitude of the snapback? And the reason I'm asking is, I think if I just take your bookings in the fourth quarter, and if I add maybe EUR0.5 billion service sales, then it looks like we should be well above EUR1.6 billion.",".

Operator: Thank you, Kai. Our first question today is from André Wüst, Berenberg Bank. André, please go ahead.

André Wüst, Berenberg Bank - Analyst 

Thank you, Kai. So I wanted to ask you about the visibility of the second quarter results. Can you give us a sense of how much upside there is in terms of bookings and service sales? And also, what could be the magnitude of the snapback if the results are below expectations?

Kai Korschelt, ASML Holding NV - CEO 

Thank you, André. So as you can see from our fourth quarter results, we generated EUR1.6 billion in total bookings and service sales. So we're well above our guidance range and we're seeing good momentum in both our product and services businesses. So I don't think there's any significant upside potential in terms of bookings or service sales. However, we'll continue to monitor the market closely and take appropriate actions if necessary.

          Well, we don't want to leave you down any particular number, but we chose the word significantly wisely, so we wouldn't do that if it would be just a little bit up.

So I'm just wondering, broadly, what are the reasons?

          Yes, Kai, I can address it, as well. First of all, there are no structural changes in the sense that you should be worried that pricing came down, or we have any cost issues.",".

1. What are the reasons for the lower than expected Q1 revenue? 
2. Do you think that if demand and revenues rebound in the second quarter, we should expect to settle back at the 47-48% range?"
Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: This is purely a function of lower volume at one, and then more so a change in mix between products and customers. And then also within the service and field options, that the service is a bit higher when compared to the field options, which come at higher margin. And then you can also read that when we say foundry is lower and memory is higher, foundry tools are usually in a richer configuration going to the customer.
Now, if you want to look at Q2, we won't give you an exact number. But when you consider that the volume will go up and the foundry shipments will go up, and it's 10 nanometer, it will be pretty nicely configured tools, you'll know in which direction the margin will go.

          Sandeep Deshpande from JP Morgan. My question would be, Peter, on the memory market. You've said that you are going to have a flattish trend in the first half in the memory market. Do you see this, into the second half, substantially correcting? Or you don't have visibility at this point into this segment?
Secondly, I have a quick question on EUV as well. Clearly, EUV is progressing much better at this point in terms of throughput, and you've given some of the statistics. What time frame do you see EUV actually being built for production volumes? Thanks.

What is the outlook for the memory market?
ASML expects the memory market to remain flat in the first half of 2016."
Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: On the memory market, like I said in the introductory comments, we have very clear visibility given by our customers, also evidenced by our bookings that we received in the fourth quarter. On what we are going to ship in the first half, we're just focused on also the introduction of the new DRAM nodes. So you could say it's clearly a technology transition that is driving the shipments in the first half.
We don't have that visibility yet on the second half, is our current thinking. I can only give you some indication of what was said by some of the market research analyst firms. They expect   and if they are right, and 25% bit growth for next year would mean about flat wafer capacity year-on-year, 2016 versus 2015.",".

Question: What is your outlook for the memory market in the first half of 2016?
Answer: We are expecting a bit of bit growth in the memory market in the first half of 2016."
Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: So that means that if the initial shipments of the technology [trends] happen in the first half, then the second half will be lower than all capacity additions needed.
How much lower? That's a bit too early to say. But clearly first-half technology trend and transitions; and second half, probably a lot less.

          On EUV throughput, yes, and on that we've made good progress. We've agreed with our customers the targets for 2016, and we have good confidence that we are going to get there.",".

Q: What are the 2016 targets for EUV throughput?
A: We have agreed with our customers the targets for 2016, and we have good confidence that we are going to get there."
Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: You have to look at 2016 as, I would say, the last phase in the EUV introduction of where our customers are developing their next nodes for which they are planning their production output in 2018 and 2019. So, it's the last phase of the development node, and the qualification of those architectures that we will see in 2018, 2019, hitting the market.
That means that 2017 will be the year where we will start to see the start of the EUV shipments for production, and they will be used in 2018. And that will accelerate through 2018. So 2017 will see the first start to make sure we can do   customers can do the output in 2018, which will accelerate in 2018 further on.",".

Question: What is the expected production output for 2018 and 2019?
Answer: We expect that in 2018, we will start to see the first shipments of our customers' nodes that are based on our latest architecture, which is based on EUV.

          Yes, a couple if I could   or rather one, and one follow-up. So, I just wondered if we could talk about 10 nanometer ramp, now you've got maybe a bit more visibility around it. Should we still be thinking about 10% pure wafer starts between the 2016 14 node and the 7/10 nodes, but also a 40% to 50% lithography intensity increase?

          Okay, okay, sorry. Yes, yes. Yes, it's basically  that's the assumption on the 10% that we still work with. We don't have any other data. I'll comment on that a bit later, also. The 40% litho intensity, yes, that's what node-on-node   that's still what we think is a realistic number. On the node-on-node wafer capacity reduction, the 10% is still what we are using.",".

Q1: What is the assumption for the 10% of technical difficulty?
A1: The assumption is that there is still a 10% chance of technical difficulty."
Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: You have to bear in mind that, starting from the 28 nanometer node, we see those nodes extending a lot longer than what we saw in the past.
And you've been around a long time, so you know that, between 5 and 10 years ago, nodes had a two-year life. And then the previous nodes stopped, next node came, and lasted about two years, and almost all logic customers moved in that same time period, which is less the case today, or not the case today. We see the initial acceptance of a new node being driven by the leading-edge customers. And they install, rather swiftly and rather fast, a quite a significant amount of capacity.",".

What is the average node life expectancy?
The average node life expectancy is 5-10 years."
Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And then you see the other customers in that segment, you could say the second-tier customers, following later.
That is also what we see today. 28 nanometer is still being shipped, even in Q1 of 2016, which is more than four years after the initial introduction. So, you can see kind of a camel back in the first phase of that node, and then a much longer tail. Which also makes it more difficult for us to say how much will that wafer capacity for that node be. We assume 10%, but over time we will   it needs to be proven whether this is the correct number.

          Yes. From a lithography point of view, the 16/14 node is very similar from a little half-pitch dimension point of view, very similar to the 20 nanometer node. So you really should not go past 16 and 14, from a litho pitch point of view, to 10, but really 20 to 10. And that's a big shrink.",".

What is better, the term of yield or the cost per transistor?"
Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: And, as you know, shrink has a big impact on the cost per bit. And so it is driven by cost per bit. And for some customers, actually it's also value; just putting more functionality on the same square surface. That's what's driving it.

          So you'd see   to make clear, you see the cost per transistor going down at 10 nanometer node?

          Okay. And maybe just one follow-up. You gave guidance for the full year   I mean quantitative guidance for the memory   so Flash being flat, and DRAM going down. I'm not sure I understood for logic and foundry what the trend are, in term of quantitatively compared to 2015.",".

          So the trend is that the cost per bit is going down. And for logic and foundry, it's actually going down more than for memory."

          Well, I think the   Wolfgang said the first quarter is relatively benign, but we really see the ramp starting in Q2. And then also we are extending into IDM, not only for foundry but also IDM on 10 nanometer, which will be the remainder of the year, which will drive the remainder of the year.",".

Question: What was the ""relatively benign"" first quarter?
Answer: The first quarter of 2015 was relatively benign, with ASML seeing a modest increase in revenue from its foundry business."
Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: Now, if you just look at the size of that ramp   and the ultimate size for this year is always a bit difficult to predict in the third week of January, so as we are very early in this year.
But if you look at that   what customers are telling us, it's going to be a significant ramp, and will be driven by the leading-edge players, not so much by the followers, which will follow on, I said as an answer to an earlier question, which will probably have a much longer tail. But the initial ramp up we are seeing will be significant, and that causes us to state that the 2016 logic market for us will be significantly higher than 2015.",".

          For logic, that includes logic and foundry, or that's just purely logic?

          Good afternoon, C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. I guess first question, I know there's a lot of moving parts here, but curious what are the key milestones we should be watching for EUV to be designed in at the 7 nanometer node.

          Okay. So, for our customers, it's most important that they have a certain level of productivity. And then secondly, we're seeing that the yield is increasing as well. So, I think those are the two key milestones that we should be watching for.

Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 ASML Holding NV Earnings Call: But it's very important that when you start planning your production, that availability is critical. So, the 80% availability target is what we agreed with our customers. This is what we are, at least, following. I also like to refer to our presentation, where you can see that.
On productivity, quite interesting: one of our key customers   in the question that was asked recently on where the 500 wafers spread day would be sufficient for them to go into production, assuming a reliable or a, let's say, good availability of the tool. And the answer was yes, they would use it. So, you can draw a conclusion from that answer, that it's not so much now about the productivity, it is about the availability. So this is what we are really focusing on this year.

What is the 80% availability target for ASML Holding NV?"
