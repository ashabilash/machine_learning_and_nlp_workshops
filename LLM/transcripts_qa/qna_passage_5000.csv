Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up year-over-year, reflecting primarily an increase in the site's TAC rate, which was modestly offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites.",".

Edited version Q4 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: I'll cover results for the full year 2017 because it remains most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer time horizon, as discussed on prior calls.
Results for the quarter are in our earnings release. For the full year 2017, Other Bets revenues were $1.2 billion, up 49% versus 2016, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $3.4 billion for the full year 2017 versus an operating loss of $3.6 billion in 2016. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $507 million, down from $1.4 billion in 2016, primarily reflecting a reduced investment in Fiber. We're pleased with our progress across Other Bets. A couple of updates:
Nest turned in a strong holiday performance in the fourth quarter across an expanded family of products in energy, safety and security.",".

What was the main driver of Nest's growth in the fourth quarter?
Nest's growth was driven by an expanded family of products in energy, safety and security."

And just last week Onduo, a joint venture between Verily and Sanofi, began a limited commercial launch of its diabetes management platform.
At Waymo, progress is accelerating. For example, Waymo surpassed 4 million miles of driving in the real world, taking only 6 months to achieve the last million miles compared to about 18 months for our first million miles. And in November, Waymo announced that it is the only company to have a fleet of driverless cars on public roads that are completely autonomous without anyone in the driver seat.",".

What is Waymo's fleet of driverless cars on public roads that are completely autonomous without anyone in the driver seat?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Let me close with some observations on our priorities and longer-term outlook,
Our 23% revenue growth in 2017 was powered in particular by the ongoing extraordinary performance of our sites business. Both mobile and desktop search continue to grow and benefit from our approach to innovation with strong momentum as we identify additional opportunities to enhance the user and advertiser experience.
As we've consistently emphasized, alongside the continued momentum in our advertising business, we are focused on building a second wave of growth within Google over the medium and long term, which includes the rapidly growing revenue businesses in Google: Cloud, hardware and YouTube.
With respect to Cloud, we are seeing the benefits of a fully featured enterprise offering and an expanded go-to-market team, bringing our advantages in infrastructure, data analytics, security and machine learning to more customers.",".

What is the long-term outlook for Alphabet's advertising business?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: And we're pleased with the momentum in our hardware business in 2017, driven by an expansion in both our product line and geographic availability.
Finally, as we look further into the future for our third wave of growth, we remain excited about the longer-term potential for our Other Bets businesses.
Overall, operating income was up 22% year-over-year in 2017, excluding the impact of the EC fine, although there was obviously fluctuation in the rate of operating income growth quarter-to-quarter. Within cost of revenues, the biggest component is traffic acquisition cost, reflecting our strong revenue growth in mobile search and the fact that mobile search carries higher TAC than our desktop business.",".

Q: What was the biggest driver of operating income growth in 2017?
A: The biggest driver of operating income growth in 2017 was an expansion in both our product line and geographic availability."
Edited version Q4 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: While we expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of sites revenue, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, we anticipate that the pace of year-over-year growth in sites TAC, as a percentage of sites revenue, will slow after the first quarter of 2018.
Within OpEx, we are keenly focused on prioritization in order to optimize the resources we're investing for longer-term growth. As I discussed on last quarter's call, marketing spend in the fourth quarter is significantly elevated, in particular, supporting hardware, but also across Cloud and YouTube. For 2018, we remain excited about the investments we are making to drive the next phase of growth in our big bets in Google, in Cloud, hardware and YouTube, and our machine learning efforts, which are powering innovation across our businesses.",".

What is the reason for the slowdown in year-over-year growth in sites TAC, as a percentage of sites revenue?
The slowdown in year-over-year growth in sites TAC, as a percentage of sites revenue, is due to the fact that the pace of growth in mobile search is slowing."
Edited version Q4 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: You'll see us continue to support our priority areas with increased headcount, which will remain concentrated in R&D. With the closing of our deal with HTC earlier this week, for example, we've added 2,000 employees to support our hardware business.
With respect to SBC, we've completed the transition to a single annual compensation cycle for employees with a full year equity refresh grant to employees in the first quarter of 2018. Our biannual grant to SVPs will also occur in the first quarter, and you will see the combined step up in our first quarter results.
For our Other Bets in 2018, we will continue to calibrate the magnitude and pace of investment appropriate to their individual execution paths.
Finally, our framework for capital allocation is unchanged from our prior discussions.",".

Question: What is the size of the workforce that Alphabet has added to support its hardware business?
Answer: The size of the workforce that Alphabet has added to support its hardware business is 2,000 employees."
Edited version Q4 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: The primary use of cash continues to be to support organic growth in the business. We're excited about the significant opportunities we've identified in our businesses and continue to invest appropriately. We then layer in a sensitivity analysis regarding potential M&A as well as CapEx, in particular, computing infrastructure to support the needs of these growing businesses. The most sizable catalyst for added investment in compute power include the expanding application of machine learning efforts across Alphabet, as well as additional requirements for Google's Cloud, Search and YouTube businesses. This framework further considers complementary uses such as a share repurchase.",".

Question: What is the primary use of cash for Alphabet Inc?

Answer: The primary use of cash continues to be to support organic growth in the business."
Edited version Q4 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: After taking these potential investments into account, our Board has decided to extend our share repurchase program up to an additional $8.6 billion of Class C capital stock.

And then, Ruth, looking at cost of goods sold, that came in quite a bit higher than we thought, and you were lapping a one-time charge, if we have it right, versus the year-ago period.

                                                   Thanks, Eric. On the Google Assistant and Google Home, we are very excited about the momentum we saw in CES. It actually reflects work we've been doing for a while. Google Assistant in some ways brings together all the technology we've been building for years, and it's an extension and it's supported by Google Search as well. We are also thinking about our capabilities broadly beyond just one device alone. And that's what we are doing here across phones, across all surfaces. So that's something big we are focused on. And the second is we always build ecosystems, be it Android or Chrome or Chromebooks.",. Q1: What is the momentum you saw in CES for Google Assistant? A.

                                                   And then in terms of the gross margins, it obviously reflects our product mix.

And then the other thing to note, other cost of revenue does reflect the seasonality of hardware, having increased both the number of products in the Made by Google family as well as continuing to expand geographically in Western Europe and APAC.

Q: So on your first question, what strategies do you think will be different in 5 years?
A: We don't really have any specific plans to change our traffic acquisition strategies as we look ahead."
Edited version Q4 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: But the rate, as per your question, has also reflected changes in partnership agreement. So all factors considered, we expect the year-on-year increases will slow after the first quarter of '18. And as I've said on many of these calls, we're very pleased to have a very strong position in a rapidly growing market, and that momentum does continue. I guess, the only other thing to add is that Q4 TAC as a percentage of revenues does benefit from the fact that the fourth quarter is a seasonally strong quarter for YouTube. So quarter-on-quarter changes are less insightful because CAC is distinct from TAC. It's not in this number. But not much more to add there.

Edited version Q4 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We obviously see it being adopted strongly in countries like India. It's actually a significant part of just mobile search queries in general. And things like Google Assistant and doing Google Home kind of really accelerates the trend. But we definitely see more multi-modalities. So as you saw, we also announced many smart displays at CES. And I think that will be an exciting trend as well. So we'll bet on all of that. In general, I think about we want to be there for users when they need us and we want to serve everyone. That's why we work across the ecosystem. We do first-party devices. We do it globally. And so we are committed to doing that well. So I think it'll be an extension of how we have approached search from day 1 and trying to serve everyone.",".

Douglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [10]
                                                   Some big news earlier this week just in terms of Waymo with FCA talking about delivering thousands of minivans to Waymo later in the year. So I was hoping, Ruth, you could just talk to us more about the timing for that business and how we should think about the economic model there as you move to operations and deployment phase. And then, secondly, the cash, now obviously much more accessible in terms of what is held overseas. Can you just talk more about your plans there. Obviously, a bigger buyback there, but still not meaningful in terms of the overall size of the company.",".

Douglas Till Anmuth, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD

So Waymo is still in the testing phase and they're still working out the kinks. They don't have a specific timeline for when they'll be ready to go into full operations. They're still working out the logistics of that. And then with respect to the cash, they've been able to bring in a lot more cash recently because they've been selling off some of their assets.

                                                   Sure. So first on Waymo, we do remain very excited about the opportunity with Waymo and our continued progress on multiple fronts, in particular, the rider program in Phoenix, we're excited about and we're expanding our testing to more states. In November, we announced that Waymo's self-driving TAC reached a major milestone, becoming the only company to have a fleet of driverless cars on public roads that are completely autonomous. And that builds on our more than 4 million test miles driven in the real world in 7 states, 25 US cities, we're currently driving   self-driving, I should say, 10,000 miles every day, with billions of miles in simulation and robust testing at our private facility.",".

And riders will be able to use our Waymo app to hail one of our fully driving   self-driving cars without a driver at the wheel. So very excited about that. And then in terms of cash. I think the main point, as we think about it, is there's no change in our approach to our capital allocation framework. We've consistently been focused on long-term investing.",".

And we do remain active with smaller M&A deals, in particular, to support our Cloud business in hardware. The HTC deal, which we just closed, is a good example of that. Third is CapEx. So we continue to invest in machines to support growth we see across Google. But in particular, supporting Cloud, Search, YouTube and all that we're doing in machine learning.

Could you just talk about some of the drivers of the strength of desktop. And how do you think about the sustainability of continued strong desktop growth into 2018 and beyond?

And that's why last quarter, I tried to walk through the process that our team goes through and the way they look at innovations really stepping back and recognizing that the way we all use smartphones and desktop is continuing to evolve. And so therefore, there's utility and challenging assumptions about evolving user behavior and advertiser preferences, and that opens new lines of inquiry, which benefits not just mobile, but also desktop.

Yes, we continue to see strong growth in YouTube viewership and engagement. We saw a 50% increase in watch time in North America in the fourth quarter of 2017, and we continue to see strong growth in mobile viewership. In fact, we now have more than 1.5 billion monthly active users on YouTube."

And then Ruth, just a question on the growth in marketing spend. In the fourth quarter, I think you said that the 4Q is significantly elevated. Should we interpret that to mean that the growth rate in selling and marketing year-over-year should decelerate off the 4Q? And then just related to that, [in] getting a good return on investment from this marketing spend, particularly when you think about media mix and all the spend that we've seen on TV as compared to digital marketing.

And as Sundar and I have said, these are important Google growth areas for us and we are investing to support growth in the business. The elevated levels this quarter did reflect both seasonality and strategic decision to invest in these brands.

But above all, I think we've always   we've been doing cloud now for 19 years because Google itself was built on a cloud platform.

In   we obviously want to make sure YouTube has a great experience for users, content creators and advertisers because it supports content creators. And we took a lot of steps last year, but particularly in December, we are up to a new rigorous approach. And that's a much more stringent standard for creators.

Waymo's business model has evolved over time as we've grown our business. We started out as a technology provider, and now we're also a ride hailing service. We're excited to launch our service in Phoenix this year."
Edited version Q4 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: You've worked with manufacturers. You talked about other models. But when you think about the sort of 5 to 10-year view of that, what will the primary business model look like? And separately, can you talk about what is interesting from a strategic point of view about the video game business? You're making some key hires there. And I'm just wondering what you think Google can bring to that industry that would be innovative.                                         
Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - CFO and SVP    [41]
                                                   So on Waymo, really not much more to add. We're really pleased after years of work on technology where it was really about safety, safety, safety and developing the technology and the platform. And now, we're in a position where we have this opportunity to let people use and benefit from what we've developed.",".

What is interesting from a strategic point of view about the video game business?

Operator    [1]
                                                   Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Intel Corporation Q1 2016 earnings conference call. 
(Operator Instructions) 
As a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference to Mark Henninger, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.                                          
Mark Henninger,  Intel Corporation - VP of Finance & Director of IR    [2]
                                                   Thank you, Nicole, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's first-quarter 2016 earnings conference call. 
By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release, CFO commentary, and the announcement of our restructuring program. If you have not received all three documents, they are available on our investor website INTC.com. 
I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO, and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer.",". 
Question: Brian, can you give us an update on the restructuring program? 
Answer: We announced a restructuring program earlier this month that will result in the elimination of up to 6,000 positions globally. We expect this program to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2017. We'll provide more detail on the program in our CFO commentary later this week. 
Question: Stacy, can you give us an update on the company's outlook for 2016? 
Answer: We're seeing good momentum in our business and we're confident in our ability to continue delivering strong performance in 2016. We expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits and earnings growth in the high single digits."
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them followed by the Q&A. 
Before we begin let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. 
And a brief reminder that this quarter we provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures following the acquisition of Altera, now our Programmable Solutions Group. Today we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures. The CFO commentary and earnings release available on INTC.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. 
With that out of the way, let me turn it over to Brian.                                          
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [3]
                                                   Thanks, Mark.",".

Question: What are the non-GAAP financial measures that Intel is referring to?
Answer: The non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA."
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
Our results in Q1 were in the lower half of the range we set in January and reflect an extra work week in the quarter. Revenue increased year-over-year driven by an expanding business portfolio that now includes the Programmable Solutions Group formerly known as Altera. Strength in our Data Center, Internet of Things, and Programmable Solutions businesses partially offset weaker than expected PC revenues in our Client business. 
I'll take a minute to review our Q1 results before talking about the restructuring program we're announcing today. CCG revenue grew 2% year-over-year. We saw ongoing declines in the PC TAM, particularly in China and other emerging markets, which also led to greater than anticipated reductions in worldwide PC supply chain inventory. Declines in the PC segment were offset by a richer core mix and a 14th workweek.",".

Question: What was the main driver of revenue growth in Q1?
Answer: The main driver of revenue growth in Q1 was an expanding business portfolio that now includes the Programmable Solutions Group formerly known as Altera."
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
The Data Center business posted another good quarter, growing 9% over last year on strong cloud and comms service provider demand, partially offset by ongoing softness in the enterprise. The Internet of Things Group grew a remarkable 22% year-over-year, due largely to the performance of the video and retail verticals. In the Memory business, strong unit growth was offset by pricing declines, leading to revenue that was 6% lower year-over-year, and in our Security business, revenue grew 12% as this team continues to tighten its focus and execution. 
And finally the PSG group, formerly known as Altera, got off to a great start. It delivered a revenue of $359 million, and after adjusting for $100 million in acquisition-related accounting charges, the business achieved mid-single-digit growth.",".

What was the growth rate for the Data Center business? 9%"
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And less than a quarter after the deal closed, we are shipping our first FPGA Xeon co-packaged parts to customers in sample form. 
These results tell the story of Intel's ongoing strategic transformation, which is progressing well and will accelerate in 2016. We are evolving from a PC company to a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart connected and computing devices. The Data Center and Internet of Things businesses are now Intel's primary growth engines, and combined with Memory and FPGAs form and fuel a virtuous cycle of growth. 
Last year we achieved record revenue in the Data Center, Internet of Things, and Memory businesses. We delivered a combined $2.2 billion in revenue growth, and made up 40% of our total revenue and contributed the majority of our operating process.",".

Question: What is the main growth engine for Intel?
Answer: The Data Center and Internet of Things businesses are now Intel's primary growth engines."
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Today we announced a series of actions that will build on the strength of those franchises and accelerate our strategic transformation. 
Through this initiative we will intensify our investments in the products and technologies that fuel the growth in the Data Center, IoT, Memory, and FPGA businesses, and we expect it will result in an even more profitable Client business. These changes will reduce our global employment by about 12,000 positions by mid-2017. We will do this through site consolidation, voluntary and involuntary separations, project reevaluation, and an intensified focus on efficiency across a variety of programs. 
These are not changes we take lightly. We will be saying goodbye to colleagues who have played an important role in Intel's success. Yet acting now gives us flexibility.",".

What is the initiative that will result in 12,000 job reductions by mid-2017?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Flexibility to continue to invest in those client segments that are growing, including 2-in-1, gaming, and home gateway, among others. 
Even more importantly, acting now enables us to increase our investments in areas that are critical to our future success. This restructuring program will allow us to expand our investments in the Data Center, the Internet of Things, Memory, and connectivity, even as we reduce our spending run rate by roughly $1.4 billion by mid-2017. 
This is a comprehensive initiative. It's designed to create long-term value by accelerating the fundamental long-term change already happening at the Company today. We will emerge as a more collaborative productive team with broader reach and sharper execution, and we expect it to result in the highest revenue per employee in the company's history. 
Last, but certainly not least, we have one additional announcement today.",".

What is the $1.4 billion reduction in spending that Intel plans to make by mid-2017?
The $1.4 billion reduction in spending that Intel plans to make by mid-2017 is a reduction in spending run rate."
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: I'm happy to share that Stacy Smith will be taking on a broader new role within Intel and reporting to me, leading sales, manufacturing, and operations. Stacy has been a great business partner and a world-class CFO, and I'm looking forward to continuing the partnership as he brings his leadership, his depth of knowledge, and his breadth into these critically important areas for Intel's future. We expect this transition to occur over the next few months following a formal CFO search that will assess internal and external candidates. Stacy will remain in his CFO role throughout the search and transition process. 
Congratulations, Stacy, and with that, let me turn the call over to you.                                          
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - EVP & CFO    [4]
                                                   Thank you very much, Brian, and I really appreciate the kind words.",".

What is Stacy Smith's new role within Intel? He will be reporting to me, leading sales, manufacturing, and operations."
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
Revenue for the first quarter was $13.8 billion, up 8% year-over-year. The quarter showed year-on-year growth and was in the low end of the range of our prior outlook. Within this, we are seeing growth in the Data Center, Internet of Things, Security, and Programmable Solutions Groups, all of which helped offset a weak PC market. 
First-quarter gross margin of 62.7% was approximately a point higher than our expectations, driven by lower 14 nanometer costs. R&D and MG&A was $5.4 billion, down over $100 million from our guidance. Operating income of $3.3 billion was up 13% from a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.4%, about seven points lower than our prior outlook. Earnings per share of $0.54 was up 20% from a year ago.",".

What was the main reason for the 8% year-over-year growth in revenue?

The main reason for the 8% year-over-year growth in revenue was growth in the Data Center, Internet of Things, Security, and Programmable Solutions Groups."
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
The Client Computing Group had revenue of $7.5 billion, a 2% increase year-over-year. This was below our expectations due to a weaker than expected PC market. Operating profit for the Client Computing Group was $1.9 billion, up 34% from a year ago. This improvement is driven by lower 14 nanometer unit costs on notebooks, lower overall total spending, and margin improvements in our mobile products. 
Data Center Group had revenue of $4 billion, delivering 9% growth on a year-over-year basis. Relative to our expectations, we saw weaker enterprise business offset by strength in the cloud segment. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.8 billion, up 4% year-over-year as we ramp our 14-nanometer server product. 
Our Internet of Things segment achieved revenue of $651 million, with year-over-year growth of 22%.",".

What was the Client Computing Group's revenue?
$7.5 billion"
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We saw strength in both the retail and video display segments of our Business. Internet of Things operating profit was $123 million, up over 40% relative to last year. Our Security business had revenue of $537 million, up 12% year-over-year. 
Our Memory business had revenue of $557 million, up 6% year-over-year. The segment had an operating loss of $95 million as a result of challenging pricing, increased 3D XPoint spending, and startup costs as we ramped 3D NAND in our China factory. 
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $359 million. When adjusted for the approximately $100 million of deferred revenue, and compared to Altera's results for a year ago, the business achieved mid-single-digit revenue growth. 
Operating profit was a negative $200 million.",".

What was the company's Internet of Things operating profit?
$123 million"
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: This included over $300 million in non-cast charges for deferred revenue and inventory adjustments, plus certain acquisition related charges. Excluding these charges would result in low double-digit operating margin growth for this business. 
We generated $4.1 billion of cash from operations in the first quarter. We purchased $1.3 billion in capital assets, paid $1.2 billion in dividends, and repurchased approximately $800 million of stock in the first quarter. Total cash balance at the end of the quarter was roughly $15 billion, down $10 billion from the prior quarter as a result of closing the Altera acquisition. Our total debt is approximately $25 billion, consistent with our prior commentary on the financing plan for the Altera acquisition. 
As we look forward to the second quarter of 2016, we are forecasting the mid-point of the revenue range at $13.5 billion.",".

What is the company's outlook for its operating margin in the second quarter of 2016?
The company expects its operating margin to be in the mid-single digits in the second quarter of 2016."
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: After adjusting for the extra work week in the first quarter, this forecast is in the low end of the average seasonal increase for the second quarter. We are forecasting the mid-point of the gross margin range to be 61%, plus or minus a couple of points. This decrease in comparison to the first quarter is driven by lower platform volumes. 
Turning to the full-year 2016, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits from 2015, down from the prior guidance. We are forecasting robust growth rates in the Data Center, Internet of Things, Non-Volatile Memory Solutions, and Programmable Solutions Groups, which we expect to offset the decline in the Client Computing Group. 
We now expect the PC market to decline in the high single digits in 2016, versus our prior forecast of mid single-digit decline.",".

What is the mid-point of the gross margin range for the second quarter?
The mid-point of the gross margin range is 61%."
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Our projection of the PC market remains more cautious than third party estimates. We are forecasting the mid-point of the full-year gross margin to be 62%, a one-point increase from the prior outlook, driven by lower platform volumes. 
Our execution to our strategy is driving growth. We are building on our strong position in Client, and are investing for growth in the Data Center, Internet of Things markets, and disrupted differentiated memory technology. The trends over the last two years demonstrate that we are well into this transformational journey. 
From 2013 to 2015 the PC TAM declined 10%, yet Intel's revenue grew 5%, and our operating profit grew 14% over this horizon. But as Brian mentioned, we want to accelerate that execution. In order to do that we're going to go through a significant restructuring over the next several months.",".

Question: What is the PC TAM?
Answer: The PC TAM is a measure of the market share of PCs sold by Intel."
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: The goal is to come out of this more agile, more efficient, with more investment in our key growth initiatives, and more profitable. 
When completed by mid-2017, these actions will result in a 12,000 person workforce reduction, and a $1.4 billion reduction to our spending run rate. Relative to full year 2016, we are now revising our spending guidance down by over $700 million to $20.6 billion. 
We expect to realize over half of the total workforce reduction by the end of this year. In the second quarter of this year, we are taking a $1.2 billion restructuring charge on the GAAP P&L, with an estimate for the related actions.",".

Question: What is the goal of the restructuring charge?
Answer: The goal of the restructuring charge is to reduce costs and improve efficiency."
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
These actions are significant and we don't embark on this lightly, but we are confident that they will build on the strong position we have across markets, and accelerate the transformation of the Company that is already underway. 
I would like to end on a brief personal note by saying thank you to Brian for the upcoming new leadership opportunity. Intel changes the world with amazing technology, and I am proud of what we've accomplished, and I'm excited about the opportunity that's in front of us.

So if you could just talk us through some of what's changed strategically in the Company that's led to such a large amount of turnover so recently?                                          
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [3]
                                                   Sure.",.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: I mean, if you take a look at it, so let's step back for a second and just talk about why are we doing the restructuring now, and then we can talk about some of the specifics beyond that. 
So we've talked about this transformation, that we're moving from a client-centric, you know Intel's been typically known as the PC company, to a company that is focused more and more on a much broader set of products, and really focused around the cloud, right? And the cloud, and all the connected devices that connect to that cloud, and the connectivity that brings those devices to the cloud. 
And that includes the PC, but it's much more than that.","

What is the main reason for Intel's restructuring?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And so what this effort around the restructuring is, is to say, it's time now to try, and we've made enough progress, right? You take a look at it, 40% of our revenue, 60% of our margin comes from areas other than the PC right now. It's time to make this transition and push the Company over, all the way to that strategy and that strategic direction. So that's why we wanted to do it now. 
Let's talk then about the leadership changes. There's really only been three leadership changes, if we just take the last couple of quarters. 
We had Doug Davis, he is simply retiring. Those are personal reasons. That has nothing to do with his leadership or direction of the Company. 
It's IoT. We've talked about IoT as one of our growth segments. It grew 22% this quarter.",".

What is the name of the segment that grew 22% this quarter?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: It's clearly   his performance in the group is strong. And he's staying until we find a successor, roughly the end of the year, we think, something like that. 
Kurt chose to leave for some outside opportunities. And the one that Stacy and I have been working for several months, actually several quarters, on what does he do next, how do we growth his both exposure to other parts of the company and also the rest of the company see his leadership style. 
And so what we wanted to do is, as soon as we'd made the decision, is go ahead and start a search and start looking for a CFO replacement. We wanted to be completely transparent, be very open about that and let everyone know. 
This is going to be an orderly transition.",".

What is Intel's plan for replacing Kurt?
Intel plans to replace Kurt by the end of the year."
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We are just going to start the search. Stacy is solid in the CFO seat in that meantime, but this gives him a chance to see other parts of the company. If you take a look at the group manufacturing operations, which is everything from purchasing to building construction and all, and sales, it's roughly half the Company and people. And so it's a really good opportunity to see how the real operations of the Company work.

What is Intel's guidance for full-year 2016 growth?

Intel's guidance for full-year 2016 growth is mid single-digit."
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: When I put that together with the high single-digit decline now that you have in the PC business, I'm having a little hard time seeing how, if you take the seasonality of PCs out of the equation, in large part, what would be the lever that would get you there in the back half of the year, considering that a ramp well into the $15 billion range in revenue seems to be a prerequisite. Are there some moving parts you could describe to us that get you comfortable with that number?                                          
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - EVP & CFO    [5]
                                                   Sure, let me walk you through how we're viewing the year.",".

1. What is Intel's view of the year?

Intel's view of the year is that they are expecting a decline in PC sales in the back half of the year."
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And first let me just put it at the highest level, right? 
What we're projecting for the year is overall growth, and we think we'll see growth in the Data Center, growth in IoT, growth in Memory that's offsetting some, oh and of course we've added in Altera now into our product family, and so you take that and that's offsetting some of the weakness that we're seeing in the PC market. 
Specific to the PC market, as we said in our prepared remarks, we are now expecting that the PC market is down in the high single digits, and when we started the year we were in the mid-single digits decline.",".

Q: What is Intel's projection for the PC market?
A: Intel projects that the PC market will be down in the high single digits."
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
The linearity, so first you have to understand, the first half is impacted by the fact that as our customers view of the market came down, and if you recall we had a more cautious view of the market than they did when we started the year. They were bringing down inventory levels, and that impacted us in Q1 and I think you'll see the same impact as we forecast a roughly seasonal second quarter, that we'll continue to see those customers burning off inventory. We think that doesn't repeat in the back half, so it's a little bit of a tailwind. 
I'd also say, you want to be careful of, we guided to mid-single digits. That's a range.",".

Question: What is the impact of customers' views of the market on Intel's first half results?
Answer: The impact of customers' views of the market was that it impacted Intel's Q1 results."
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: If you are mathematically trying to drive to a specific number there, you may be driving more backend than what we're really anticipating. So just a caution there that that's a range, it's meant to be directional of how we see the Business. All of that said, I just want to say I think Brian and I are very comfortable with the back end and what's implied in our guide, based on everything that we know.

I really just wanted to follow up on the restructuring.",".

What is the impact of the restructuring on Intel's future cash flow?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Is it more an effort to make the client more profitable, or are you really trying to drive revenue and redefining maybe more employees than you're letting go?                                          
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [9]
                                                   So it is absolutely a situation where we are structuring to be able to allow ourselves to invest at a faster rate in those growth areas. 
If you take a look at it, 2016 to 2015, in the areas of Memory, with our NAND technology, IoT, Data Center, even before this action, we were investing more in 2016 than in 2015 in those areas. This will allow us to, even with the cuts, even with the dollar figures that Stacy has read out on the savings, it's allowing us to invest even more in those segments.",".

Q: What is the reason for the investment in 2016 over 2015? 
A: The reason for the investment in 2016 over 2015 is that we are structuring to be able to allow ourselves to invest at a faster rate in those growth areas."
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
And I always want to make sure, it's not just about cutting costs necessarily in the client area. You know, we think that we can become more focused. There are areas of the client space that are growing. 2-in-1s are growing at double-digit rates year-over-year. Gaming PCs are growing at double-digit rates year-over-year. Set-top boxes are growing, and we are gaining share in the set-top box space. 
So we're doing very well in segments that are growing in the client space and the PC space. And we are going to continue to double down and focus on those. So it's really a narrowing down and allowing us as a result also to invest more in those growth areas. That's really what we're doing here with this restructuring.",".

                                                   And Blayne, just to make sure, if you look at the CFO commentary, just to make sure the financial answer is clear there, the $1.4 billion in run rate savings is a net number. So I just want to be clear on that. That's what we expect to achieve, and that is encompassing the fact, like Brian said, that we'll be increasing investments in a lot of different areas.

Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
And then I know mobile is within Client, but I was wondering if that's a segment that you expect to contribute to growth this year, and if you can just talk about your confidence in reaching the cost savings for the year?

                                                   Sure. Absolutely on schedule for hitting our committed $800 million, and just like last year we'll shoot to do better than that. Mobile is absolutely continuing to grow for us as a segment, and we're continuing to increase our profitability. If you look underneath the numbers here, you'll see that the profitability within the mobile space continues to improve for us, this year over last year.

                                                   Yes, you can really see it, Blayne, in the CCG operating profit.",.

And when you parse out the big contributions there, there's some ASP good news, but the really big chunks are the improvement in the margin on our mobile products, and decreases in investments that we talked to you about in the past that were all included in that mobile profitability. So you can, you'll see this play out in the CCG profitability over the course of this year, and you can see it in Q1.

                                                   Sure, so let me start and then we can just talk about, remember the majority of our Memory space is built into SSDs that are going into the Data Center, so you call those, really those higher-end performance class systems. 
What we're saying, if you take a look at units, units grew quite nicely year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter for the Memory Group. You're right, we are seeing aggressive pricing in this space.",".

Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
The Memory segment, the NAND segment especially, tends to go in these cycles where there's overcapacity in the industry, and aggressive pricing, and then it shifts back to more normal pricing, and then tight pricing, which is always very positive. 
So this is just a normal cycle. We think we've done a very good job of structuring the business that we ride through these with a high degree of confidence. If I look forward, we believe the 3D NAND technology that we're just beginning to ramp in our factories today, and we're building out the Dalian factory for later this year startup, gives us a real cost advantage in this space and will allow us to even be more profitable in even these kinds of environments. 
So we're still confident that this business will continue to grow.",".

Can you tell us what it might have been year-over-year without the extra week, and why did pricing fall again this quarter?

                                                   Yes, so like we said when we started the quarter, that extra week was that week between Christmas and New Year's. When you look at where that 14th week fell, it's a relatively light, but it certainly had some impact, so I don't want to say none. But it's a little hard to figure it out on any given business.

Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
In terms of the pricing, it's pretty simple in that it was the growth rate that we saw in the networking segment. So what you would see, with a constant mix we would have seen ASP up in the Data Center, but the networking segment grew 50% year-on-year, which is exactly consistent with our strategy, and so what you see there is strong unit growth offset by a little bit of a mix down.

So first the simple answer. If you take a look at our forecast, we continue to forecast ASPs increasing through this year. So that's absolutely built into our forecast, and we've modeled in things like you described: the weaker enterprise computing, and the difference between the pricing segments.",".

What is the impact of slower enterprise computing on Intel's ASPs?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
And I always remind people that, let's just start at the very top as, when you take a look at the Data Center, it's not one product. It's a family of products that really spanned from Xeon 5s that sell for several thousand dollars, to the networking processors that are a few hundred dollars at times. 
But within each one of those families - so whether you have networking or cloud or hyperscale or enterprise computing - our ASPs are increasing, and that's mostly due to bringing in better products, people buying up the ladder in product, and resulting in a higher ASP on average for any one of those segments. So you will see slight shifts in the overall Data Center ASP. 
We have a boomer quarter like this, like Stacy talked about.",".

You know revenue was down about $309 million sequentially. Operating profit was down $411 million sequentially.",".

John Pitzer,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   

Our Data Center Group operating profit was down primarily due to lower revenue and higher costs. We continue to see strong demand for our products, but we are seeing increased competition in the data center market. We expect this pressure to continue through 2017."
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: I know there's lots of moving parts, you have the extra week of OpEx that might not been fully covered by revenue. And Stacy, you talked about in your opening comments, the 14-nanometer ramp starting to hit there. 
But with this new narrative of declining ASPs because of mix, I'm wondering if you could tell me how we should be thinking about operating profits in the business going forward? I think it was about 44% in the March quarter, down pretty significantly in the December quarter. Is this change in mix also having an impact on operating profits?

                                                   Yes, so John, you nailed it in terms of what's going on with operating profit in Q1. It's just the early cost of the ramp of the 14-nanometer server product.",".

Question: What is the impact of the 14-nanometer ramp on operating profits?
Answer: The impact of the 14-nanometer ramp on operating profits is that it has decreased operating profits in Q1."
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: That's what's causing that to behave a little differently from revenue. 
And back to Brian's point, I would say no, there's nothing in the mix that per se would cause me to have a different view of the overall profit potential of this business. 
So taking networking as the example, it does have a lower ASP than the Xeon product line does. It also has a very different cost structure than the Xeon product line does. So it doesn't cause us to being a different space from overall operating profit percent.

First is, no, I'm not worried that the PC will shrink to a point where the scale won't get large enough to fund either the factories or the other innovation. In fact we talked about the restructuring actually makes us more profitable in the PC. That's allowing us to invest even more in those growth areas. Remember also those growth areas are growing, and so they are replacing some of the volume in the factories as they grow.",".

Question: What are the growth areas in the PC industry?

Now let's talk about the PC, you asked how do we take a look at the PC long-term, and how do we make sure we're making the right investments, which to me that's the key, right? That's what we really tried to do with this restructuring, is take a look at the areas that are growing, that we believe we can bring innovation to, that will make a difference to the end-user. 
You are going to see more investments in 2-in-1s. You're going to see more investments in thin and light devices. You're going to see us push even harder on high-end gaming systems, which are growing at a very fast rate, and they tend to buy up the stack to the very, very top.",".

So there are absolutely segments we'll continue to invest and continue to innovate in. There's some very innovative systems in design right now, that bring new functionality and new thinness and lightness to the market for the second half of this year. And we'll do that. 
What we're going to do is make sure we're doing this as most efficiently, and not doing it spread out across all PCs and all form factors. And that's what we've really tried to do with this effort right now.

Q: What was the primary driver of the 19% increase in ASPs for client servers?
A: The primary driver of the 19% increase in ASPs for client servers was primarily due to improvements in CPU performance and pricing."
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: What you'll see is that notebook was pretty flat from an ASP standpoint year-on-year. Desktop was up 6%, so that is one of the [adverse] to profitability. 
And then the big difference is what happened in phones and tablets. On a year-on-year basis, I think I termed it in the CFO commentary, up significantly as we weaned ourselves out of some of those counter revenue programs that we talked to you about. So that actually had a fairly significant impact on the overall ASP for CCG.

                                                   Sure, good question, Vivek. First I'll just tell you that, having been raised by Andy Grove, always paranoid about the competition, always driving, and you know that we live or die by the performance of our product.",".

1. How do you assess the competitive landscape in the data center market? 
2. How do you think it will play out on the compute market?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We believe that if you take a look at our road maps, we have strong competitive leadership that should allow us to continue to have the position in the market that we currently have. 
I think also you have to take a look at some of our strategy that is becoming much much broader than just the CPU. What we're trying to do is really provide top of rack to bottom of rack solutions, that bring   that work together and bring performance across the whole rack. And that starts with rack scale architecture itself, which is a very unique architecture that will allow people to build racks in a much more denser and lower cost way, through silicon photonics within rack communications. Then we go to 3D Xpoint.",".

Question: What is the strategy behind 3D Xpoint?

Answer: We believe that 3D Xpoint is a unique architecture that will allow people to build racks in a much more denser and lower cost way, through silicon photonics within rack communications."
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And then you have our whole CPU architecture, from networking, storage, up through server. 
So we believe we are uniquely positioned to provide that whole rack viewpoint, and have everything work together and come together to bring, really, performance that is just unbelievable. And that's what's key to really keeping our position, is to understand the whole rack from top to bottom. And that really is our strategy when you take a look at it. 
In the other areas, like you said, networking and storage and the telco area? Those are areas that we're gaining share, and as they move to software-defined infrastructure, and basically virtualized infrastructure, it plays right into the Intel architecture, and really what we do best which is general purpose computing.",".

What is the strategy for keeping their position in the market?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And that same architecture from top of rack to bottom of rack plays out in those areas as well, like in the telco area. 
So we believe our strategy absolutely will maintain our position in that. But we're always paranoid and we're always realizing we get there by performance of those products.

As a follow-up, I know you probably have answered different pieces of this question, but perhaps Stacy, you could help us quantify what Intel started operating margins are this year, or maybe even longer term. Because when I look at a lot of fabless semiconductor companies, they can get towards 20%, 25% operating margins, and when I look at a Foundry, a DSMC, it's able to get close to 40% operating margin.",".

What is Intel's operating margin?
Intel's operating margin was 34.9% in Q1 2016."

Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - EVP & CFO    [64]
                                                   Let me give you some elements of it, and then I would expect we'll have a much more in-depth conversation on that at the next investor meeting. But I'll give you some insight into how Brian and I are thinking of this. 
First and foremost, we believe there's growth potential here. So from a top line overall company standpoint, we think that there's significant opportunity to grow.",".

1. What growth opportunities do you see for Intel? 
2. How do you think the restructuring actions will help to grow the company?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And I think we've executed well in terms of growing over the last couple few years, even as PC TAM declined, and that's very consistent with our strategy as invest in the Data Center, in Memory, and IoT, and things like 5G, where we think there's opportunity, and focus our investments in the Client that we've talked about. 
In terms of the overall model, the financial model for the Company, I've given you this range of 55% to 65% gross margin as being   most of the data points landing between those goal posts. If you look at it over the last five years, we've very consistently been in the very high end of that gross margin range, so it's more like between 60 and 65%. Last year we were 63%. This year we believe we are at 62%, so that continues.",".

Question: What is the gross margin range for Intel Corp.?
Answer: The gross margin range for Intel Corp. is between 60 and 65%."
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: I don't see anything on the horizon that changes that in the near term. 
And then with these actions that we're taking, when we get to full realization, and I want to stress, we do believe that this will give us an opportunity to reinvest in the business and actually accelerate growth, but if you just look at the cost side of it, it's 2 to 3 points of spending as a percent of revenue when we get to mid-2017, and full realization. That takes our spending as a percent of revenue, even just based on your estimate of 2016 revenue, it's 2 to 3 points, it takes us back down into the low 30s from a spending as percent of revenue.",".

Question: What are the actions that Intel is taking to achieve this goal?
Answer: The actions Intel is taking to achieve this goal are investing in its technology and product pipeline, and reducing spending as a percent of revenue."

And then for my follow-up, in terms of the growth opportunities that you are pushing for, IoT, DCG, etcetera, if you look at the margin profile of them, memory and basically cell phone processors, it's substantially below your current margins. My question is why would you want to pursue two markets like that where the margin profile is so much lower than yours?                                          
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [71]
                                                   Sure, so let's dissect those. From memory, one, we believe that if you take a look at our typical margins, they're better than cell phone margins on typical quarters.",".

1. Why do you believe that Intel's margins are better than those of cell phone processors?
2. What is the margin profile for memory and cell phone processors?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: But also it's integral to the Data Center, so it really actually is this virtual cycle that, especially as we move to 3D NAND and then to 3D Xpoint, as we've talked about 3D Xpoint and how that really re-architects how memory and storage is played out in the server rack and in the data center overall, it's a chance to really very uniquely shift that whole infrastructure. So we believe that's actually critical to our strategy in the Data Center. And we'll bring out a product with good margins. 
Now let's talk about IoT. If you take a look at it, first, it's growing quite well and if you take a look at the Data Center, I mean the IoT, right now, it grew 22% this quarter, and it has PC-like margins, so this is not cell phone chips.",".

What is Intel's strategy for the IoT?

Intel's strategy for the IoT is to grow it well and have good margins."
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: They don't tend to be cell phone chips. 
If you take a look at the segments we're really going after, which are things like automotive, or what I'll call autonomous vehicles, industrial and retail, they tend to be systems that have a fair amount of compute at the edge. They tend to have machine learning capabilities. These are systems and they tend to have a high degree of cons, more and more will move into 5G. 
But that link also between those products in IoT and 5G, and the 5G infrastructure, we believe also plays into the Data Center, and the whole Data Center strategy, and will be critical that you can provide end-to-end solutions.",".

What is the link between 5G and IoT?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So, if you're somebody out trying to build whatever that autonomous vehicle is, you need to be able to provide the 5G back end, but also the 5G out on the device, whether it's a car or a drone or a robot, or whatever it is out there autonomously moving about.

Intel has a number of advantages when it comes to IoT. For one, they have a strong Atom core processor line-up, which is well suited for IoT devices. They also have graphics and connectivity capabilities, which allow them to create robust devices. Finally, they are investing in wireless technology, which will help make IoT devices more accessible.

The IoT space is similar to the embedded space of old to some extent, and to the FPGA space, where you have, especially where we're trying to go, where you're trying to go into products that require that higher level of compute, the machine learning, and those capabilities. You have a design time, a design in time to win the design, and then you have a ramp for that product. And so those tend to take a little while. 
Autonomous driving vehicles are good example. If you're out winning designs today, you're winning 2018, 2019 car designs. Those are what are being won today. So as you bring your products to market that's what you are winning.

Operator    [1]
                                                   Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intel Corporation Q4 2015 earnings conference call.
(Operator Instructions)

Mark Henninger,  Intel Corporation - VP of Finance and Director of IR    [2]
                                                   Thank you, Sabrina, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's fourth-quarter 2015 earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it.",".

What is the company's outlook for 2016?

Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [3]
                                                   Thanks, Mark. Our results for the fourth quarter were consistent with expectations, and marked a strong finish to the year. Taken as a whole, 2015 demonstrated the benefits of our strategy, which is designed to capitalize on the growing need for the infrastructure powering the smart and connected world. That strategy is also resulting in the evolution of our business model, to focus on three key areas of growth: The data center, the Internet of Things, and memory. Our results reflect that evolution. Revenue for the year was nearly flat, despite a significant decline in PC demand.
2015 was also a year of revenue records and important milestones, and I'd like to take a minute to review some of them with you."," for each of the following:

1. What was the largest revenue record for Intel in 2015?
2. What was the largest revenue milestone for Intel in 2015?
3. What was the largest revenue growth for Intel in 2015?

1. The largest revenue record for Intel in 2015 was the launch of the Intel Xeon Processor E5-2600 v4 family.
2. The largest revenue milestone for Intel in 2015 was the launch of the Intel Xeon Processor E5-2600 v4 family.
3. The largest revenue growth for Intel in 2015 was the launch of the Intel Xeon Processor E5-2600 v4 family."
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Even though the Client Computing Group ended the full year down 8%, we were excited to see that we were able to grow sequentially in the second and third and fourth quarters. As of November, 14-nanometer products made up more than 50% of the client computing volume. And for the year, high end Core i7 micro processors and our K SKUs for gaming both set all-time volume records, leading to a rich product mix.
In our security business, we've refocused the organization on end point technology, where we enjoy a solid leadership position, and we've driven material efficiencies, as we fully integrated the McAfee organization into Intel. The results of these changes have been dramatic. On a constant currency basis, security revenue rose 6% for the year, while the organization's tighter focus drove a remarkable 44% improvement in operating income.",".

What was the organization's security revenue for the year?
$14.5 billion"
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: The IoT group grew revenue 7% in 2015 to $2.3 billion, an all-time record. As the retail, transportation and video segments all saw strong double-digit year-over-year growth.
In our NAND solutions group, we introduced a revolutionary new class of memory called 3D XPoint, the industry's first new memory technology in more than two decades. 3D XPoint is a great example of our growth strategy at work, using our technology expertise to innovate and expand into profitably adjacent markets. We think it's a game-changing technology, moving forward. Our confidence in the technology led us to announce in the fourth quarter that we were upgrading our Dalian, China fab to manufacture both 3D NAND and 3D XPoint, with production beginning later this year.",".

Question: What is the name of the new memory technology that Intel introduced in the fourth quarter?
Answer: 3D XPoint is the name of the new memory technology that Intel introduced in the fourth quarter."
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: For the full year, our memory business grew more than 20% to $2.6 billion, another all-time record.
At the same time, the Data Center Group grew 11% over last year to an all-time record of $16 billion in revenue. Macro weakness weighed on enterprise demand and resulted in slower growth than we expected at the beginning of the year. However, DCG's overall performance highlighted the underlying trends driving data center demand, as cloud and communication service providers' revenue both grew more than 20% for the year. Within the cloud segment, 40% of our volume was custom SKUs as we left the year, demonstrating the ongoing value of working directly with the customers to tailor solutions to their needs.
Finally, just after our fiscal year ended, we closed our acquisition of Altera. We're thrilled to welcome the talented Altera team to Intel.",".

What was the main reason for slower growth in enterprise demand compared to expectations?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Combined, our two companies will deliver powerful synergies based on Intel's process technology leadership, and the integration of Altera's FPGAs.
Wrapping up, our results over the last year leave me increasingly confident in our strategy. While our outlook for the first quarter reflects some caution about overall demand, particularly in China, we continue to expect solid growth in the business in 2016. Because it provides tremendous return to our shareholders, we will continue to drive innovation and differentiation in our core PC business. This business provides a foundation of IP, and a source of cash flow, but it's not the sole driver of our growth.
Our future as a Company will increasingly be a product of the virtuous cycle of opportunities in the data center, memory and IoT market segments.",".

What are the opportunities in the data center market segment?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: In fact, you can see the impact of that virtuous cycle in our 2015 results. DCG, IoTG and memory delivered nearly 40% of Intel's revenue, and more than 60% of Intel's operating margin in 2015. Additionally, these three adjacent markets delivered $2.2 billion in profitable revenue growth in 2015 alone, and as we look ahead to 2016, we'll continue to build on that strategy. Now with that, let me turn it over to Stacy.                                         
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [4]
                                                   Thanks, Brian. The fourth quarter was a strong finish to the year, with record revenue at $14.9 billion. We had record revenues in the data center and Internet of Things businesses.",. Q: What was the main driver of record revenue in the data center business? A: The main driver of record revenue in the data center business was growth in our core Intel Xeon processor products.
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Gross margin of 64% was up 2 points to outlook, net income was $3.6 billion, down 1% year-over-year, and earnings per share was $0.74, flat over the same horizon.
I would like to provide context behind our full-year 2015 financials, as it provides insight into how we are executing to our strategy. Growth in the data center, memory and Internet of Things businesses partially offset a weaker than expected macroeconomic environment, and a weak PC client market. Overall, revenue for the year was $55.4 billion, which was down 1% from the prior year.
The Client Computing Group achieved $32 billion in revenue, and was down 8% for the year. Within the Client Computing Group, we achieved almost $1 billion in mobile profitability improvements over the course of the year, exceeding our goal.",".

Question: What was the Client Computing Group's revenue for the year?
Answer: The Client Computing Group's revenue for the year was $32 billion."
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: The data center business, at about $16 billion in revenue, grew 11%. The memory business, at over $2.5 billion in revenue, grew over 20%. And the Internet of Things business, at about $2.3 billion, grew 7%.
Gross margin for 2015 was approximately 63%, down about a point from 2014. Higher unit costs as we ramp 14-nanometer were offset by an increase in ASPs, driven by strong results in the data center business, and a rich mix in the client computing business. Operating profit for the year was $14 billion, down 9% year on year. Earnings per share for the year was $2.33, up 1% from the prior year.
In 2015, the business continued to generate significant cash, with $19 billion of cash from operations. We purchased $7.3 billion in capital assets.",".

What was the gross margin for 2015? 63%"
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We paid $4.6 billion in dividends, and repurchased about $3 billion of stock. Total cash balance was $25.3 billion, up over $11 billion year-over-year. Our net cash balance, total cash less debt, and inclusive of our other longer-term investments is approximately $6.6 billion. We issued about $9.5 billion of new long-term debt to finance our acquisition of Altera, and in November we announced an $0.08 dividend increase to $1.04 per share on an annual basis, effective in the first quarter of 2016.
The acquisition of Altera was completed in early FY16, which means that the 2016 guidance includes the expected results for the FPGA business. As I talk to our guidance for 2016, it is important to note that we have excluded non-cash and one-time acquisition-related charges for Altera.",".

Question: What was the total cash balance as of December 31, 2015?
Answer: The total cash balance as of December 31, 2015 was $25.3 billion."
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: The CFO commentary pre-released before this call and available on INTC.com includes the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations.
For the first quarter of 2016, the midpoint of the revenue range is expected to be $14.1 billion. This forecast, which includes an extra work week, and the newly-acquired FPGA business, is on the low end of the average seasonal range. This outlook represents a soft start to the year as we remain cautious on the level of economic growth, particularly in China. We continue to believe the worldwide PC supply chain is healthy, with appropriate levels of inventory. Gross margin for the first quarter is expected to be approximately 62%, and spending is expected to be $5.5 billion.
Turning to the full year 2016, we are expecting revenue growth in the mid to high single digits, relative to 2015.",".

What is the midpoint of the revenue range for the first quarter of 2016?
The midpoint of the revenue range is expected to be $14.1 billion."
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: This outlook is higher than our previous guidance provided at the November investor meeting. This higher range is driven by the addition of the FPGA business, partially offset by some caution as a result of uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. Gross margin for the year is expected to be 63%, and spending is expected at $21.3 billion. The capital spending forecast for 2016 is $9.5 billion, up from 2015.
As the economic useful life of our manufacturing equipment lengthens, we are extending the depreciable life of equipment in our factories from four to five years. This change in depreciable life drives approximately $1.5 billion in lower depreciation expense for the year. Inclusive of this change, we are forecasting depreciation expense to be $6.5 billion this year, down $1.3 billion from 2015.
Our results demonstrate that we are transforming the Company.",".

What is the gross margin for the year?
The gross margin for the year is expected to be 63%."
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We are pivoting towards the cloud, with a diversified portfolio of businesses. Client is still the largest segment, but the other businesses now make up about 40% of our total revenue, and 2015 marked the first year where these businesses made up the majority of our operating profit. The data center business is growing fast, and is now a $16 billion business. That growth is being driven by growth rates in cloud computing that were over 40% year on year.
Our memory business grew over 20% year-over-year, and is well positioned to disrupt the industry with the launch of 3D XPoint technology. The Internet of Things business grew in 2015, and is expected to contribute more growth this year.",".

What is the largest segment of Intel's revenue?

The client segment is the largest segment of Intel's revenue."
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And with the Altera acquisition, we expect to broaden our product portfolio in the data center and Internet of Things businesses, and enable even more innovation. Most importantly, we are pivoting towards the cloud, diversifying our client business, and building a strong foundation for long-term growth for the Company. With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.

What is the long-term growth strategy for Intel?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call:

                                                   Great. Thank you so much. The client average selling prices went up again for the second quarter. Is that the same trend you saw in Q3, a stronger high end, and what's your assumption for the ASP trajectory going forward?                                         
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [3]
                                                   Sure. I'll start, Joe. This is Brian. It was the same type of trend we saw throughout 2015, with clients buying up the stack, and you saw it in our record revenue in Core i7 and K SKUs, which are really our top-end SKUs. The forecast for 2016 has us relatively flat in this space, so we don't know if it will continue. But right now, we forecast it at flat, the ASPs, for 2016.",".

                                                   And just to add, Joe, so   there was a client comment. In total, we see ASPs up a little bit in 2016. You can see it in the gross margin recon.
It's not   as Brian said, we're maintaining the client ASP, but we are expecting that server becomes a larger percentage of the mix. So we've got some mix impact, based on what's going on in server.

What is the client ASP for Intel's products in 2016?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Thanks.
And then for my follow-up, the depreciation change   was that something you had known about when you talked about the full-year guidance at the Analyst Day, and what was it that prompted you to make that change now?                                         
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [6]
                                                   No, the depreciation change was not included in my forecast that I provided back in November. We were in the middle of the analysis.

What prompted Intel to do an in-depth analysis of the cadence of moving from one process technology node to the next?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And we completed our long-range planning in the fourth quarter, and that's what triggered the change in the depreciation cadence.
I'll also say   so, just to then tie this out for you, in November I was forecasting a 62% gross margin for the year. I'm now projecting a 63% gross margin for the year. And the difference there is this change in depreciation. So, you can kind of see it in that gross margin recon.

We're looking at the long view, and we're very confident that, yes, we'll continue into this double-digit growth in the Data Center. It will continue to be fueled by the cloud in the first side, and then secondly by our growth in telco and networking, as our share grows there. Remember, we entered the year at less than 10% share in that space, and there's a lot of space there for us to grow in the networking and Telco space.

                                                   It's not an impact at all, Stacy. This is   whether we're at 2 years or 2.5 or 3 wasn't going to dramatically shift that life expectancy like this. This is more about the amount of reuse, and the efficiency and speed at which we can do the conversion. And so, both of those numbers have improved.
Now, the cycle   clearly it doesn't hurt to have, from this perspective, the longer node cycle. But independent of that, this is a change that was fundamental to the shift in reuse and rate at which we're able to move the tool from being able to run, say, 14 nanometers to 10 nanometers.",".

I'll give you the accounting answer here, too, which is: If we got to 7 nanometer or 5 nanometer and there was something that caused us to look at the depreciable life, the economic usefulness of the equipment, we would change it. But we're certainly not expecting anything like that. But this is   we go through this analysis every year.",".

And so, we'll be constantly trying to get this to be a longer and longer number, if possible, independent of the nodes, because it just shows that we're becoming more efficient.

Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [37]
                                                   A little earlier than that. So, the background on this is, we go through this every 5 to 7 years.",".                                           

The extra work week is in Q1 of 2016, not Q4 of 2015."
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Because we're on a work-week calendar, over a 5- to 7-year period, we get out of sync with the actual calendar. And then we add in a workweek, in order to get back on sync. It's a little   it's easy actually to quantify the spending associated with that extra workweek, because we've got lights on, and factories running, and we're paying people.
The revenue associated with it is a little harder to calculate. When you look at where the week actually falls, it's that week between Christmas and New Year's. Our fiscal year ended, I think, the day after Christmas, and so it's that week between Christmas and New Year's that tends to be a billings week that's dramatically lower than any other week we see during the year.","

What is the revenue associated with the extra week in the calendar?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So, some revenue impact; hard to quantify it.
The way I'd look at it though, when you look at our guide, and you take out Altera, and you take into account any impact for the extra work week, what you'd see is that the guide for the first quarter is at the low end of what we normally see from a Q4 to a Q1, is how I'd think of it. And then you add Altera back on top of that, and you get to the revenue number that we provided.
And just to be totally transparent, the revenue number for Altera in Q1 is on the order of $400 million. So, you can do the math from there.

                                                   Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question.
Brian, the first question I have is on the DCG business. This quarter, the December quarter, you saw a modest drop in ASPs, both sequentially and year over year, which is somewhat of an anomaly for that business.",".

What was the main driver of that decline? And what do you think is going to be the main driver of future growth in that business?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And I guess I understand the mix shift, as cloud grows faster than enterprise.
I'm curious: Do you think this was a one-quarter anomaly? Is this something we should expect more of, as networking grows faster in 2016? And within the individual segments, are you still seeing customers buy up the stack?

                                                   So, that's actually a great question, John. So, for Q4, the decline, or the decrease in ASP was mostly driven by the much higher growth rate in the networking, as you mentioned, and the fact that the percentage of Atom in networking tends to be a bit higher.",".

Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: If you look at networking as a whole, the ASPs in networking tend to be lower than, say, cloud or enterprise.
However, if you look at Q4's networking ASP   so, if you took out just that ASP, and you compared that ASP relative to prior quarters, it was actually up as an average. So, it has a lower average selling price, but that average selling price is increasing as more people buy   and as NFV and SDN take off, more people tend to buy up to core, because they're really searching for that performance.","

What is the average selling price for networking products?"

The relative strength   so, then if you take a look at the cloud space and the enterprise space, we expect those to continue on the trends you've seen over the last few years. We don't expect any major shifts there, but we have very strategic plans to continue to grow in the networking, storage, and especially around the telco and networking space, as SDN and NFV really take hold.",".

                                                   Yes, it does, very helpful.
Stacy, as my follow-on, you raised the full-year gross margin by about 100 basis points, but if I do the math, a $1.5 billion decrease in depreciation on a $60 billion revenue stream is more than 100 basis points. In addition, the Altera gross margin was higher than your core. And so I guess I'm trying to understand, what are the offsets? Is 10-nanometer cost coming in higher than expected? If you could help us understand the progression of 10-nanometer cost throughout the year, that would be helpful.                                         
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [44]
                                                   Sure.",".

Question: What are the offsets for the 100 basis point increase in gross margin? 
Answer: The offsets for the 100 basis point increase in gross margin are primarily due to the 10-nanometer cost decrease."
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And a great question. I know there's a lot of moving parts here.
Let me just focus in on the depreciation change for a second, and I actually try to be very transparent. In the CFO commentary that was released, you'll see some of this written out, so you can always refer back to it. But the change in depreciation, you're right, in total, is about $1.5 billion. But only about half of that is flowing through COGS, and impacting gross margin in 2016. And that's where you get to the 1 point shift.
That really is the primary difference. There's a few other moving parts, but nothing that's material.",".

What is the primary difference between the $1.5 billion depreciation change and the 1 point shift in gross margin?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: That's the thing that changed from 62% gross margin forecast that we had in November to 63% gross margin forecast that we have today.
The rest of the change in depreciation   about a quarter of it will flow through OpEx, because remember, all of the spending we do for research and development facilities actually flows through our research and development line, so you see a little bit of a benefit there. And then you have some of it that goes into inventory, and then ships out over time.

                                                   I'd articulate that what we're seeing   we have a cautious stance as we start the year. There's a couple of things that feed into that.
Units were a little weaker for us in the client segment in Q4. As we worked our way through the Christmas selling season, what we saw is the sell-through all the way to the end customer was a little less than we thought.",".

Question: Can you give us more detail on what specifically was weaker in the client segment?

And then, our team on the ground in China has gotten fairly cautious about what's going on in China right now. And as you know, that's the largest PC market. So, we're just a little cautious on the growth rates there.
In terms of from here, I think Brian said it well. We're expecting   this is the environment as we work our way through 2016. So, against the backdrop of a somewhat weak macroeconomic environment, we expect the year to play out normally from here.

Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: I think that's down like somewhere in the mid-teens or something like that, sequentially.

I can tell you from our perspective, we didn't see anything that was surprising, in terms of what we've seen about their business levels. We actually expect some revenue growth as we go from 2015 to 2016.
I'll give you in total what we expect for Altera. It's a little north of $1.6 billion in terms of revenue.",".

Question: What is Intel's forecast for Altera's revenue in 2016? 
Answer: Intel expects Altera's revenue to be around $1.6 billion in 2016."
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Its gross margin, that as John was saying, is a little higher than the corporate average, so it gives us a slight mix. But because it's a relatively small business against the backdrop of Intel, it's not a big shift in our gross margin. And then we're expecting spending that's at a run rate of a couple hundred million dollars a quarter.
In addition to all of that, there will be a bunch of one-time acquisition deal-related costs. There's amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. You'll see all those in the GAAP number. I've excluded them from the non-GAAP numbers I just gave you.

Stacy, one question on the OpEx side, back to that leverage question: You had a very useful slide at the analyst meeting about how you had dis-invested in some areas, and increased investments in another. I guess my net question is: Given that ability to do a substitution in the past, is there any limitation on that going forward? Or if you were going to keep spending more on some of the growth initiatives, is that actually going to be all incremental to the level we have now?

I'll also say there's a point at which we expect that we get more and more leverage in businesses like the Data Center, as well. I think there's lots of opportunities for us to bring down spending as a percent of revenue, as we go forward.

You'll see it   if you look on a dollar basis, it will go up in Q1 as a result of Altera. So, Altera will cause the inventory levels to go up some. But when you look at it from a business standpoint, I think we'll work through the inventory we have.

                                                   Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your line is now open.

What is Altera's guidance for Q1 2016?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Thanks for taking my question.
Stacy, the roughly $400 million of Altera   I don't expect you to report it going forward, but just curious, how does that fit into your reportable buckets? Can you just level set us for the first quarter out?
And then secondly, could you just talk about how you're integrating or not integrating Altera? I feel like I've heard both. It sounds like you wanted to keep the sales force separate, but just curious, where does that report under, and how much integration are you going to do?                                         
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [64]
                                                   Sure. I'll take the accounting question, and then I'll have Brian give you his insight and philosophy on the whole integration.
On the reportable segments   so actually, I do plan to give you full visibility into Altera.",".
On the integration, we're still in the early stages of assessing what we would do and how much integration would be required."
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: It's a relatively small business for us. It doesn't hit the SEC reporting requirement. So, it doesn't come across that threshold.
But we just feel strongly that, based on transparency, and the size of the acquisition, we want to give you transparency. So, you will see that in our financials going forward.
I'll let Brian answer the integration question.                                         
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [65]
                                                   From an integration standpoint, I think what you see   what you've seen we've done with McAfee is we've integrated it into Intel Security, and you saw the great results that we showed in the fourth quarter. Those are somewhat an example of what happens as you integrate, and you really get the focus on the business on a much higher level.
Same thing for Altera; we plan to fully integrate it.",".

1. What was the integration of McAfee and Altera?
2. What were the great results that Intel showed in the fourth quarter as a result of the integration?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: It's going to look like a business group, no different than, say, CCG, that does PCs and modems, phones, or DCG that does data center.
It's called PSG, Programmable Solutions Group. It reports directly to me, and it will be fully integrated.
The sales force at the beginning, because the sales tends to be a bit more technical, and a bit more like a field sales engineering-type role, we're keeping it separate. But that's something we're going to continue to evaluate.
But the organization, the engineering   already in the first two weeks, we've had   really for me, I'm really pleased with the level of integration and help that we've done to get products and road maps focused and integrated into our internal systems. So, you should expect it to be fully integrated.",".

Q: What is the name of the company that Intel Corp is integrating its PSG into?
A: The company is called Programmable Solutions Group, or PSG for short."

                                                   Thanks, Blayne. Operator, I think we have time for two more questions.                                         
Operator    [67]
                                                   Perfect. Our next question comes from the line of David Wong of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.

                                                   Thanks very much. What might we expect in the way of new 14-nanometer data center processor families in 2016?                                         
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [69]
                                                   Let's see, I think we've got Broadwell Xeon; it's going to launch in the first half here of 2016. So, that will be the first of the 14-nanometer, or the next 14-nanometer in 2016 is that E5 on Broadwell. The rest of them, we haven't put any other dates out there yet   Skylake SKUs and so forth.",".

                                                   Okay. Great. And my follow-up: With start-up and other charges, do you expect memory output in China in 2016 will be a positive or negative contribution to EPS, and should we expect a positive contribution in 2017 from the China fab?                                         
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [71]
                                                   There will be some pretty significant costs. It's in the gross margin recon, associated with the startup of the factory in China. And we'll be in production in the back half of the year, but we're just ramping production.
I think if you were just looking at a six-month time period, you'd say it's negative, and you can see it in the gross margin.",".

Q: What is the expected contribution from the China fab in 2016?
A: The China fab will have a negative contribution to EPS in 2016."
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: It's a slight negative on the gross margin.
It doesn't change the fact that we make these investments, and then we get this, what I would say, tremendous long-term benefit out of making that investment. So, that doesn't   I don't want you to take from that, that we're somehow less bullish on the transformational capabilities of what the team has managed to pull off at 3D XPoint, because we're actually quite bullish on that.

What was the reason for the change in depreciation from $1.5 billion to $2.3 billion for the quarter?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: I know, Stacy, you talked about it being due to reuse, but I guess relative to just the fundamental cadence of the migrations, your intent has been to get back on a normal, Moore's Law cadence. I just want to make sure that's still the case.

                                                   Yes. We said that   this is Brian, by the way, not Stacy   that 10-nanometers would be closer to that 2.5 years than the 2 years; that we would continue to strive to get back on 2 years. Some of that was how, as we [still define] 7-nanometers, what the complexity of the technology looks like, whether EUV is ready or not. Absolutely, we're pushing to get back on that two-year cadence.",".

Q: What is the cadence for 10-nanometer products?

                                                   I would just add, please don't take the accounting of the depreciable life to be somehow a signal that we're letting our foot off the gas on process technology cadence and process technology leadership. That's the heartbeat of the Company, and we're driving it; we're driving it hard. The accounting just is looking at how long that equipment is economically viable in our factories, and it's pretty clearly five years, as we go forward.

                                                   Right. Okay. Got it.
And then just last question: So, on the mobile group, at the Investor Day you talked about another $800 million improvement this year in the losses.",".

                                                   It's absolutely still the target. That has not changed one bit.
It's a little early in the year to talk about progress. We have   I'd tell you that we have a large percentage of that $800 million already, I'll call it, planned out. In other words, we have projects. We know what we need to do, introduce products, align which SKUs are coming, and move products onto that.
So, I'd say a large percentage of that is well planned through the year, but it's throughout the year.",".

Q: What percentage of the $800 million has been planned out?
A: A large percentage has been planned out."
Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So, I can't tell you   I've already got $200 million of it, or something like that, not here in the second, third week of the year.
7360   it's out. It's sampling. The customers are going through their validations now at the systems, where they are building up systems and out testing them on networks, and so forth. And as far as the launches of those systems and the announcements, those are always up to our customers, and we don't make sure that we're the ones announcing that. And then, what we've told you is that what's even as important is that we're on a yearly cadence now of our modem technology, and we're very confident on that as well, for the next set of modems that comes out after the 7360.",".

Question: What is Intel's cadence for modem technology?
Answer: Intel's cadence for modem technology is yearly."

Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Intel Corporation second-quarter 2016 earnings conference call. 
(Operator Instructions) 
As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Henninger. You may begin.                                          
Mark Henninger,  Intel Corporation - VP of Finance & Director of IR    [2]
                                        
Thank you, and welcome everyone to Intel's second-quarter 2016 earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com. 
I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO, and Stacy Smith, our Chief Financial Officer.",".

Q1. Brian, you mentioned that the company is seeing good demand for its products in China. Can you give us more detail on that?
A1. We're seeing good demand for our products in China, and we're seeing good demand for our products in other parts of the world as well. We're seeing good demand for our products in the PC market, the data center market, and the mobile market.

Q2. Stacy, you mentioned that the company's gross margin was down in the second quarter, but you also said that the company's operating income was up. Can you give us more detail on that?
A2. Our gross margin was down in the second quarter primarily due to increased product costs, partially offset by increased sales volumes. Operating income was up primarily due to increased sales volumes and lower costs associated with those sales volumes.

Thank you, and we'll take your questions."
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: In a moment we will hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A.

Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. 
Also if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measures or references, we'll post the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliation to our website, intc.com. With that, let me hand it over to Brian.

Thanks, Mark. Our top-line results for the quarter came in right in line with outlook. And profitability this quarter exceeded our expectations.",".

Q1 2016 outlook: ""We expect our top-line results to come in right in line with our outlook.""
Q2 2016 results: ""Our top-line results for the quarter came in right in line with our outlook."""
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Year-over-year growth this quarter was 3% overall as we transformed Intel into a Company that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected devices. We continue to focus on growth in line with this transformation, as evidenced by results in the data center, IoT and programmable solutions business this quarter. 
I'd like to take a few minutes to walk through these results and their implications. I will start with the Client Computing Group, where we saw a 3% decline in revenue year over year this quarter while operating margin was up 19%. These results were a little better than we expected, as the PC supply chain reduced inventories at a slightly slower rate while the two-in-one and enthusiast product lines continued to grow.",".

What was the Client Computing Group's revenue?

The Client Computing Group's revenue was $16.5 billion this quarter."
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We also started shipping our seventh generation core microprocessor, formerly known as Kaby Lake, and our latest LTE modem, known as 7360. 
Next the Data Center, where revenue grew 5% year over year. Cloud service providers grew 9%, comm service providers grew 10%, and enterprise was down 1%. We achieved some critical milestones in the quarter that give us confidence in our growing momentum as we enter the second half of the year. 
In the data center, we're seeing an ongoing preference for performance up and down the pricing stack. Average selling prices increased year over year in every microprocessor product segment, from Adam and Xeon D SOCs at the low end up through Xeon and Xeon Phi at the high end.",".

What was the company's primary focus in the quarter?

The company's primary focus in the quarter was shipping its seventh generation core microprocessor, formerly known as Kaby Lake, and its latest LTE modem, known as 7360."
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
We continued to gain share in network infrastructure throughout the entire segment, as Intel architecture becomes the solution of choice for the transformation of the network to SDN, NFE, and 5G. The significant share gains at the low end of the network infrastructure segment resulted in an overall 1% decline in data center CPU average selling prices. 
Progress in the data center extended beyond our CPU product lines. Our latest Xeon Phi accelerator, formerly known as Knights Landing, continued to ramp after shipping the first limited production units in December of last year. Xeon Phi revenue grew eight times in the first six months of this year versus all of 2015, gaining share in the supercomputing and machine learning segments.",".

What was the decline in data center CPU average selling prices?
The decline in data center CPU average selling prices was 1%."
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
Omni-Path, our high performance computing fabric, was launched earlier this year and has already achieved 30% market segment share of the 100-gig fabric market. In June's top 500 supercomputing list, Omni-Path was deployed in half of the new 100-gig systems, pointing to the performance that this technology brings to the market. 
This quarter we also shipped our first silicon Photonics products for revenue, the industry's only fully integrated solution. We expect DCG's adjacent product lines, including Omni-Path, Silicon Photonics and ethernet, to collectively grow more than 20% for the full year, and this quarter make up 12% of DCG's revenue. 
The Internet of Things business was up 2% over last year, coming in below our expectations. We saw growth in the industrial and video verticals offset by an inventory burn after a very strong first quarter.",".

What is the market share of Omni-Path in the 100-gig fabric market?

Omni-Path has already achieved 30% market segment share of the 100-gig fabric market."
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We continue to see tremendous potential in this business. 
A great example was demonstrated earlier this month when we announced our autonomous driving collaboration with BMW and Mobileye, marking a significant step for the auto industry as we work together to establish an industry standard, open platform for autonomous driving. In addition we're bringing Indian computing technology to power the next generation of BMW's highly autonomous and fully autonomous products, of the door locks to the data center. 
Our Memory business was down 20% over last year, and fell short of our expectations as a result of a more competitive pricing environment. While we acknowledge the cyclical and competitive nature of this business, we remain confident in our long-term growth prospects as a result of the new technologies we're bringing to this market.",".

Thanks, guys. Just a question on the server expectations for the second half.",". 

Q: What are your expectations for server sales in the second half? 
A: We expect server sales to decline in the second half."
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: What's given you the confidence that things are going to bounce back so nicely?                                          
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [3]
                                        
Sure. I will start and then Stacy can add. This is Brian, Chris. 
I think it's really a mix of a couple of things. One, we saw in the second quarter, and we project out into the second half, a bit of stabilization of the enterprise side of the market. Enterprise side was down only about 1%, which is a bit more stable than it has been. 
Second thing is we are ramping our Broadwell E server in the second half of the year. So we expect strong demand. And we typically see an ASP uplift as people buy up in the stock with the new server systems coming out.",".

Question: What's the ASP uplift for Broadwell E? 
Answer: We typically see an ASP uplift as people buy up in the stock with the new server systems coming out."
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And we have customers signals that just indicate that there is a second-half seasonal buying patterns kicking in a bit as well. 
Those three things are the second-half keys. If you take a look at a broader view of this, just overall our view of the Data Center and really the cloud continues to be that the cloud is going to continue to expand. It's going to be driven by the many, many machines that connect to the cloud that drive orders of magnitudes more data than what the average human creates today, and that's getting to the cloud. So there's kind of the short versus the longer-term point of view.                                          
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [4]

And for my follow-up, you mentioned you started shipping the 7360.",".

What is the 7360? 
The 7360 is a new Intel Xeon processor family that was announced in February 2016."
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Was that material to Q2 or will it be material to the second half? And any comments on profitability there?                                          
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [6]
                                        
Yes. So I'm not going to talk specifically about the 7360, because our policy is let our customers announce any design wins that they want to announce when they want to announce them. 
In terms of the overall impact on financials, when I look at the second half, you will note that we have an above seasonal growth rate in there. The biggest driver of that is what Brian just talked about in the Data Center. So that's kind of the biggest driver. 
We were kind of below the average annual growth rate in the first half.",".

1. What is the biggest driver of the above seasonal growth rate in Q2? 
2. What was the average annual growth rate in the first half?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We expect to be above that low double digits in the back half driven by the three things he talked about that. But in particularly the cloud buying patterns that we've identified with some of those large customers. 
And then behind that we see an improvement in revenue in Memory and an improvement in revenue in IoT. So those are the big drivers as we go into the back half.

Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: How would you characterize kind of your view of the PC business going into Q3?

Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [10]
                                        
John, how about if I start on just the view of the PC, especially into the third quarter, and then Stacy can get into the where is the above seasonal numbers coming from? I think if you look at the second half, we already said that Q2 ended up being a little bit better than what we had anticipated. And we had built the year at the high single digits.",".

We've tried to be relatively cautious as we look out into the rest of this year and built the year and the forecast around that high single digit number set for decline of the PC. We are carrying momentum out of Q2. So there's still data that needs to be collected on how it looks. But right now we have maintained our cautious view of the high single digits.                                          
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [11]
                                        
So just to translate that into seasonality against the backdrop of what Brian just said, which is high single digit decline in the PC business, we're expecting that to play out more or less seasonally, John.",".

What is Intel's guidance for the PC business for the rest of the year?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We tend to do a little bit better than that because of mix in ASP, but from a unit standpoint should be fairly seasonal. And then the driver is what I just talked about. 
The Data Center growth rate as we move into the back half should be significantly higher than what we saw in the first half based on stabilization in enterprise, what we see with the cloud customers. And then some ASP uplift as we ramp Broadwell server   14-nanometer Broadwell servers into the product mix.                                          
John Pitzer,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [12]
                                        
That's helpful, guys. Maybe for my follow-up, just looking at the Memory business. As you guys characterize, tough quarter in the June quarter, you analyze the operating loss, it's a fairly large number.",".

What is the size of the operating loss in the June quarter?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
I'm just kind of curious, have startup cost there peaked? Did we have another couple of quarters of startup costs going up in Memory? And I guess more importantly, as Dalion ramps and as you think about Cross Point, how should we think about your profitability goals longer term and what the fall-through on that business looks like as revenue does start to accelerate?                                          
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [13]
                                        
There's a short-term and a long-term component to this. In the short term, as I think about the second half, in rough math I would expect a consistent loss in the second half to what we saw in the first half. I think startup costs will be slightly higher.",".

The answer to your question is that we expect a loss in the second half, but I can't give you a specific number."
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
We will see the first production cost play through on 3-D Cross Point, which as you know from watching us over the year, those first production costs tend to be fairly high in any factory when you're starting it up. Offset by the underlying existing NAND business, I think gets a bit better as we go into the back half. So that's the short-term answer. 
To your longer-term question, and I will turn this over to Brian to talk about the technology, but I think the combination of 3-D NAND and the cost structure we're going to achieve, and then the disruptive nature of 4-D Cross Point, we should have a very good value proposition and a very good overall profit position for the business.                                          
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [14]
                                        
John, I would just echo was Stacy said.",".

What is the first production cost for 3-D Cross Point?

The first production cost for 3-D Cross Point is fairly high."
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We're just now starting to ramp our 3-D NAND. So as we go through this back half of this year and into next year, it's really starting to ramp up. 
We think large cost advantages and good performance position there. And as we said, 3-D Cross Point SSDs start to ship at the end of this year. 3-D Cross Point and DIMMs next year. 
And so these investments that we are making this year, which we have talked about, are really playing forward those two technologies. So I'm still very bullish on the long-term prospects. The units and the gigabytes continue to grow. 
Our cost structure gets better and better as we go through the back half and into next year. And then 3-D Cross Point, as we've said, will really, in our minds, change the whole memory storage architecture.",".

Great. Thank you so much. 
I wonder if you could talk about, first the Data Center, the growth, your mid-single digit growth for about three consecutive quarters. And I know you had higher expectations for that a few quarters ago. Can you talk about, is that entirely an enterprise phenomenon, or is that a timing issue around cloud? Just how should we think about the last few quarters of DCG?                                          
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [18]
                                        
So overall relative to expectations we had at the beginning of the year, let's say, it's primarily enterprise driven. And then there's what we commonly use as lumpiness quarter-on-quarter.",".

What is the primary driver of Intel's Data Center growth?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
So to how you asked the question, we actually weren't surprised by the Q2 results. In fact, they came in right in line, actually just a hair above what our internal forecast was. We have, I think, pretty good insight into the large cloud customers. And so we had some good insight into the buying patterns as those customers went from Q1 to Q2. 
And now as we look at the back half we see several purchasing cycles kicking in for some of the large guys. So we expect that the cloud piece will accelerate as we get into the back half.                                          
Joe Moore,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [19]
                                        
Great. That's helpful. Thank you. 
And then with regards to the balance sheet, I noticed both day sales outstanding and days of inventory bumped up a little bit.",".

What caused the increase in days of inventory?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And I hadn't expected that. Can you just talk about what drove that?                                          
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [20]
                                        
Yes. Those are two different things. 
I'll just start with the easy one, days sales outstanding. I'm not seeing anything unusual there. That's just the amount of net billings at the end of the quarter. The average day paid and all of that still looks really healthy. So I'm not seeing anything unusual there. 
On the inventory side, as I talked to you last quarter, we ended Q1 higher than where I wanted to be. Our yields got better in Q1. Frankly, they got a lot better in Q2 as well. And we under-shipped a little bit in Q1 relative to the units that we were expecting.",".

Question: What was the main driver of the inventory increase in Q1? 
Answer: The main driver of the inventory increase in Q1 was due to our higher yields and the fact that we under-shipped relative to the units that we were expecting."
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
So we took some actions in the second quarter to start bringing inventory levels down. What you see inside of inventory, it was kind of flattish, right in line with what we expected Q1 to Q2. It was a remixing. 
So you see some more expensive server parts and some skylight parts going up, and then you see some of the older generation CPUs going down. And as we get into the back half we would expect inventory to click down, and be down pretty meaningfully by the time we get to Q4.

What is the expected inventory level at the end of the fourth quarter?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: PC gaming has been a bright spot for the team with growth in the double digits year-over-year range for the past number of quarters. Your desktop ASPs were up again in Q2, maybe due to the strength here. 
Seems like the graphics guys are rolling out some new products. There appears to be a good pipeline of new games for the second half. So I guess the question is, did the PC gaming segment continue to drive double digits growth for the team in Q2? And how do you see that trending into the second half?

And then as you said, we often call it enthusiast gaming. You see our case SKUs in there. And then you saw us also announced the X SKU, which is our new 10-core system that has been selling much, much better than even we anticipated. And so yes, gaming and enthusiast continues to grow at a double digit rate.

To your question on the back half, we do expect to reacceleration. I had said at the investor meeting that we expect double digit growth in excess of what we had achieved last year. We still expect that. We had a strong Q1, inventory burn in Q2, we expected a strong Q3 and Q4.

Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. 
I just wanted to verify, on the DCG growth target into the back half, it sounds like you need enterprise to keep getting better into the second half as well as for the cloud and comm side of DCG to significantly re-accelerate to get there. Cloud was up 9% year-over-year. It's good, but that's a significant deceleration.",".

Operator    [32]

Thank you. Our guidance for the back half of 2016 is unchanged at $14 billion. We expect enterprise growth to be strong, with continued growth in cloud and data center services. We continue to see strong growth in our commercial segment, which is benefiting from increased demand for cloud services."
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Can you sort of give us a feeling for what you need for enterprise into the back half and what drove the deceleration in the high growth parts of this business into Q2?                                          
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [32]
                                        
Yes. I would say   I'd characterize enterprise in the back half consistent with what we saw in Q2. If it stabilizes at that rate, that gives us the ability to grow to the levels that we are projecting. 
And then for the cloud, yes, you are right. It's what I said earlier. We actually forecasted a pause in purchasing based on what we knew of the customer   the big cloud players' ordering patterns.",".

What caused the slowdown in high growth parts of the enterprise business in Q2?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And based on the signals we are seeing from them, we do expect a reacceleration in the back half to something more consistent with what we were seeing through the last couple of years.                                          
Stacy Rasgon,  Bernstein - Analyst    [33]
                                        
So what gives you confidence in enterprise will continue to stabilize and that what we saw in Q1 is not a one-quarter blip, given it's been down pretty meaningfully for the last few years pretty consistently?

Hi, guys. Thanks for let me ask a question.",".

What is the company's outlook for the rest of the year?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
Given that dynamic in the cloud on the enterprise side within DCG, do you still expect a crossover in the percentage of revenues that those two generate in the back half of this year? Or is it pulled forward a little bit, or pushed out, given the dynamics that you've described so far?                                          
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [40]
                                        
Sorry crossover from what to what, Ross?                                          
Ross Seymore,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [41]
                                        
When you said, I believe at your last analyst meeting you talk about the cloud revenue, the percentage of DCG would be somewhere in the mid-30%s and that would cross over the enterprise-generated revenue in that. And that was therefore viewed as a point of acceleration for the entire group.",".

What was the percentage of DCG's revenue that was generated from the cloud in the second half of 2016?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Wondering, given the slower growth year to date in the business, if that crossover is going to be achieved in the time you expected?                                          
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [42]
                                        
I will be honest. I haven't looked at the data from that lens. But what I'd say, let me just take you back to the answer that I gave, I think it was to Joe's question earlier. 
That if you look to the expectations we had at the beginning of the year, the enterprise is a bit weaker than we thought overall for the year. And I think cloud will be in line with what we thought. So my guess is that still true. Which quarter it happens maybe a jump ball, but my guess is this still true.",".

What is Intel's expectation for the enterprise market this year?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
But I would like the opportunity to actually go look at the data and I can give you a crisper answer next time we talk.                                          
Ross Seymore,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [43]
                                        
Okay. As my follow-up question, sticking with DCG then, is on the gross margin side. It sounds like you are expecting some pretty significant growth, not only in the unit side of the equation in DCG but also in the ASP side. 
And then you also talked about some of the ASP benefits that might happen in CCG, at least in the PC portion of it. If I put that all together, I'm a little surprised that either mix or ASPs, neither of those are mentioned in your gross margin reconciliation for it to go to 62% in the third quarter.",".

1. What is the expected growth in unit and ASP sales for DCG?
2. What is the gross margin reconciliation for the third quarter that shows a 62% gross margin?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Can you talk a little bit about how those dynamics fit into your gross margin?                                          
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [44]
                                        
Sure. So first let me start with your question on Data Center. There's a lot in there. 
So I do expect an operating margin improvement in the Data Center as we work through this year. I think we were kind of around mid-40%s in the second quarter, and historical ranges been closer to 50%, as I expected, that ticks up some as we move into the back half. The big driver there is costs. 
So the early production on the Broadwell server is fairly expensive. Costs come down as we get into the back half. And as you said, we do expect some ASP uplift in the back half.",".

What is the ASP uplift you expect in the back half?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
Overall for the Company what we're seeing, I'll use Q3 as the anchor point, we are seeing some good news in Q3 associated with higher volumes. And then the big offset there is we are seeing 10-nanometer startup costs going up pretty significantly in the back half. So that may be the piece that you are missing in the equation in Q3. 
That continues into Q4, by the way. We see a little bit more startup costs. If you do your algebra, you are probably coming up with a gross margin for Q4 that's about 62%. So think of that as some good things happen, but we have again an increase in startup costs and we have some of the Dalion costs with the first production of 3-D Cross Point that also kick in a bit more in Q4.",".

Question: What is the gross margin for Q4?
Answer: The gross margin for Q4 is about 62%."

Just a clarification on some of your earlier comments on inventory and PC. You talked about the customers taking down the inventory a little bit less than you had expected in Q2. Can you clarify why they chose to do that? And I guess with the inventory levels right now, where do they stand relative to where you would expect them to be into the third quarter?                                          
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [49]
                                        
Overall we continue to see inventory levels as being very healthy.",".

Question: Can you give us a little more detail on the inventory levels?

Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: I think that the PC   the worldwide PC supply chain has moved towards a stance of being fairly lean and fairly cautious, and we see that continuing. 
You would typically see an inventory burn in the second quarter. It was little bit less of an inventory burn then what we expected. I think it goes back to Brian's comments that he made at the beginning of the call that from their perspective the PC market was a little better in Q2. So I think they probably just brought down inventory levels a little bit less.

Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [51]
                                        
I would say for the Company you would expect to see the seasonality, a revenue seasonality for us that's in the high single digits as we go from Q2 to Q3. Our guide is a little higher than that for the reasons that we've been talking about.

I guess it's kind of a follow-on to the DCG question that Ross had brought up in terms of margins. Does the DCG business, is obviously going to diversify itself some going forward with some of the new products that you're introducing and the networking business taking off. 
The operating margin percentage is down fairly sharply year-over-year. And I would expect that to ramp back up some as revenue reaccelerates, but maybe Stacy you could talk about what the long-term margin structure looks like from an operating margin perspective in DCG as the business diversified some? Thanks.                                          
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [55]
                                        
Sure. So we'll talk about that in more depth at the investor meeting, but I'll give you some off-the-cuff comments here.",".

1. What is the long-term margin structure for DCG?
2. What is the reason for the sharp decline in operating margin percentage?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
First, to just put it in perspective, the operating margin percent decline that we saw in Q2 had nothing to do with the new products, or the new products weren't driving it. It was the 14-nanometer cost of Broadwell server. And we get in the back half we're going to see an ASP impact associated with that because we think that the performance of that product brings   enables customers to get a better value proposition by buying a richer mix. So that's why I'm pretty confident we get in the back half, we see the margin snapping back towards that 50% that we've articulated as our long-term goal. 
We'll talk more about the mix of products and whatnot at the investor meeting.",".

What is the 14-nanometer cost of Broadwell server?
The 14-nanometer cost of Broadwell server is the cost of the Broadwell server chip."
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: But the one thing I'd point you to is remember, something like networking, which is at atom-based server product that's going in. While it does have a lower ASP than the average within DCG, it has an ASP that's actually been going up and it has a very different cost structure than a Xeon does. So I won't just immediately assume that because it's a lower price segment of the market that it's a margin-hindered segment of the market because that's not the case.                                          
Matt Ramsay,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [56]

What is the ASP for the atom-based server product?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
And then I guess to follow up on, that sticking on margins, maybe you could talk a little bit about how adding the third chip on 14-nanometer may affect margins going into 2017 in the PC business to offset some of the 10-nanometer ramp costs you had talked about? I think it's a little bit of a different dynamic than we have seen with the business traditionally with the tick-tock approach. 
So any sort of broader comments you could give there about margins would be really helpful. Appreciate it. Thanks.

From a   first off, we haven't forecast 2017 margins.",".

I guess what I would talk about is Kaby Lake. One of the things we have learned on 14-nanometers is how to make meaningful performance and improvements, both in the silicon and then with the silicon combined with the architecture.",".

What is the ""meaningful performance and improvements"" Intel has learned on 14-nanometers?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So we said we already started shipping Kaby Lake to our customers and OEMs. We're seeing meaningful performance across all of the various SKUs of Kaby Lake relative to Skylight. Kaby Lake's built off a Skylight core. 
And as a result, the die size does not significantly grow. So you don't see   there's no driver in the silicon itself to shift the margin structure of this product. We're able to get the performance and feature enhancements with relatively small silicon increases but good improvement on the silicon   raw silicon technology itself. 
So there's not an intrinsic driver that should say, die size got twice as big so margins are cut. There's nothing like that.

Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [64]
                                        
So my regional view would say that certain of the   some North America and Western Europe has been stronger for us for some period of time, and it continues to be the stronger segment for us. As you said, South America, Latin America continues to be weak. 
We see weakness in Asia, but it did get a little bit better than in the past. And that combined with North America were the two drivers that made Q2 perform better than what we'd modeled in our high single digits.

You talked about stronger growth expectations looking over the next couple of years.",". 
What is the company's outlook for enterprise conversion? And secondly, what are your thoughts on the Windows 10 upgrade cycle?

Intel Corp. - Analyst Romit Shah

We continue to see strong growth expectations in the enterprise conversion market and believe that the Windows 10 upgrade cycle is progressing well."
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Just curious if you could share what conversations you have had with customers, what use cases you've uncovered? And any thoughts in terms of sizing the market?                                          
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [70]
                                        
So we haven't really tried to   we have pretty widespread guess times and models right now on sizing the market, because we are still really learning. We've actually started to ship some sample units to customers already to let them try out and start to learn. Those are to the big COG service providers, is mostly who we're sending those to. 
You're going to see it enter as SSDs. You'll see those SSDs, both enterprise-class SSDs and also commercial consumer type SSDs. We've demonstrated in several live demonstrations, anywhere from 5 to 7, 8, 9, 10 times improvement in performance, depending on the workload through those SSDs.",".

What are your thoughts on the potential for SSDs to improve performance by 10x or more?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So you're going to see those be the first implications. 
When I think about where the big volume will come from, I think it will come in that DIMM form factor. You're going to see it in cloud applications, everything from machine learning, big data, anyplace where you have memory-intensive and where you can do in-memory applications. The 3-D Cross Point is going to be nicely configured for that. It allows you to bring large amounts of storage-like data into a memory-like performance. And that's the real key here. 
I also believe you will see it in consumer devices. You will see laptops and devices like that. Gaming machines, we think it will have gaming applications where you can preload in a cache-like environment the next level of your game.",":

What is the key benefit of the 3-D Cross Point?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And so it loads almost instantly as you transition within the game. 
So there's going to be a variety of those. And actually the more we go and start to play with it, start to give it out to customers, the more types of applications and workloads we're finding that it can be used for.

That's very helpful. And I guess as a quick follow-up. 
Stacy, can you provide an update on your targeted capital structure here? And at what point with net leverage, net cash we should start to see more aggressive buybacks?                                          
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [72]
                                        
Sure. As I communicated, I think at the investor meeting or in the last six months, our goal is to get back to net cash zero.",".

Q: Stacy, can you give us an update on your targeted capital structure? And at what point with net leverage, net cash we should start to see more aggressive buybacks?
A: Our goal is to get back to net cash zero."
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And one point I had predicted that that would happen in the back half of this year. 
The combination of business levels being lower from what we thought at the beginning of the year as well as some pretty significant restructuring charges will push that out. So that will happen sometime in 2017, although I do think we will make good progress towards net cash zero as we move into the back half. Today our net debt level is right around $5 billion. So we will take a big chunk out of that as we move into the back half. 
In terms of   now that said, we're still generating excess free cash flow. You can see that even in the first half, even inclusive of the restructuring charges we did.",".

Answer: The company's net debt level is right around $5 billion."
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
And so you can see we did, I think $1.6 billion of buybacks in the first half. And we have a dividend yield that as of yesterday was about 3%. So I think you see us executing to the priorities that we had articulated.

What are your expectations for Intel becoming successful with your 4G modems in the back half?"

Sure. So let's just talk about modems. 
Really to stay on a leading edge modem, you need to have a yearly cadence of modem technology. And so we have just that, a yearly cadence laid out. We had the 7260 last year. We had the 7360 this year. 
We have a series of modems out. We've got them built out and planned for the next several years. 
We haven't publicly stated when we will bring it inside, but clearly we plan to. We will do that when the right point of intercepting the roadmap and getting the right performance off the 14-nanometers is required.",".

As my follow-up, staying on the BCG team, are you still comfortable this can be a double digit growth business over the longer term? And I guess as part of that, what role does competition play into it with all the recent noise around [Sofbang and Bangar] presumably putting more resources into it. I understand there are no near-term implications, but just longer term how do you think about growth and competition in DCG? Thank you.                                          
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [78]
                                        
Sure. So let me try and talk about why I am so confident in growth.",".

1. What is Intel's strategy for growth?
Intel plans to grow its DCG business through product innovation, expanding into new markets, and increasing its share of the market."
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We could talk about competition. And we'll see if that does not answer your question. 
When I think of the cloud, the cloud that we have today is really built on the backs of people. It's your Facebook data, it's your Salesforce data, it's your Twitter data. It's all data that is really across the devices that we pretty much handle day to day. 
The current estimates are if you look out into 2020, that average person will generate about 1.5 gigabytes a day of data off those devices. Those are going to be all your posts and pictures and all that kind of information. 
If you take a look at the average autonomous car in 2020, the estimates right now is it will throw off about 40 gigabytes a minute of data.",".

What is the average autonomous car expected to generate in 2020?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: If you take a look at the average autonomous drone doing some kind of scan looking for somebody lost in the forest or scanning a mine, it's going to throw off about 20 gigabytes a minute. If you take something like our replay technology that is filming in virtual reality a basketball game or a football game, it's throwing off 200 gigabytes a minute right now. And as we continue to refine the accuracy of that, that number will likely just grow. 
So it's that growth in data and the need to both process it at the edge, and then through the data center and into the cloud to be able to store it, to be able to apply machine learning to all of those applications, those all tell me that the cloud is going to continue to grow.",".

What is the average autonomous drone doing?
The average autonomous drone is scanning for somebody lost in the forest or scanning a mine."
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: It's going to be lumpy. 
These guys don't build out their data centers in a linear fashion. They go, they build out a big chunk of overcapacity so that they can go then sell that and have expansion space. And they don't build for a while. 
And so I know people worry about, is it slowing down? But these trends and data that tell me, no, it's not slowing down over the long term. And what you're really going to see is just the buying patterns and the build-outs of the various structures that are going up. 
As far as competition, there's always going to be competition in this market. I expect it. That's okay. We think of ourselves as competition, in fact.",".

What is Intel Corp's strategy for managing competition in the semiconductor industry?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
We are built on a model that says we have to build a continuous improvement of our products such that we are replacing ourself with a better cost per performance model over time. And so we know that even if there was no competition, the competition is we've got to build a product that's better and drives replacement as well as growth. 
And so, I look at the competition as it's welcome, it keeps us better, it's always been out there. There will always be somebody out there. But really what we have to do is build products that are so competitive that people want to replace our products with our new product. That then is one of the best models to use for making sure you stay ahead.

So there certainly is a limit to the amount of overall debt that I'd feel comfortable with, but it's not something that we have articulated externally and it'll vary by the size of the Company and the cash flow.

Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [3]
                                        
Thanks, Mark. Q3 was an outstanding quarter, which produced records in a number of product lines, and serves as evidence of our transformation to a Company that powers the cloud and billions of smart connected devices. As a great proof point, third-quarter revenue grew 9% over last year to an all-time record of $15.8 billion on broad-based strength across our businesses.
I'd like to take a minute to share a few of the highlights with you now. I'll start with the client computing group, which had a stellar quarter.",".

Q: What was the client computing group's revenue?
A: The client computing group's revenue was $8.2 billion."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: This team's focus on delivering an annual cadence of innovative new products, improving product costs, and driving operational efficiencies contributed to a remarkable 37% growth in CCG operating margins.
The client computing group's revenue grew 5% over last year, but just as importantly, DCG is playing in a direct and impactful role in our transformation. In the data center group, revenue grew 10% year over year to a record $4.5 billion. We saw the growth segments of the data center group accelerating at a rate above our forecast.
The cloud service provider segment was up 32%. In the [com] service provider segment, we continued to grow at a faster rate than the market, 16% growth, as the market converts to NFE and SDN and demand for our products increase.
In addition, non-CPU adjacencies across DCG grew an impressive 34%.",".

What was the growth rate for the data center group? 10%"
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: This category includes our new omni-path high-performance fabric, which is leading in performance and gaining design-win momentum. It includes our Silicon Photonics and our Xeon Phi, all of which began their ramps this year.
However, enterprise revenue was down 3%, trending below our expectations of a roughly flat year over year. As a result, DCG revenue growth for the full year will likely be in the high single digits.
Another key growth opportunity for Intel, our Internet of Things business, grew 19% over last year, setting an all-time revenue record of nearly $700 million. We saw strength across the board in retail, video, and transportation segments.
Revenue in our memory business was approximately flat year over year. 3D NAND production at the Dalian factory is ramping ahead of schedule, with yields matching those of our other production facilities.",".

What was the main growth opportunity for Intel in 2016?
The main growth opportunity for Intel in 2016 was its Internet of Things business."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We continue to see industry enthusiasm building for our ground-breaking new memory technology, 3D Crosspoint, and we're making steady progress toward bringing it into production.
Intel's programmable solutions group, formerly Altera, was up 6% on strength in wireline, industrial, and broadcast segments. I'm very pleased with the integration of Altera into Intel. We continued to execute against our [deal thesis], and PSG has produced three consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth compared to Altera's results after adjusting for acquisition-related accounting charges.
In the third quarter, we began sampling our Stratix 10 product, Intel's first FPGA produced on our own process technology, and also, the industry's first and only 14-nanometer FPGA. We are shipping our first co-packaged parts for the data center and are continuing to see opportunities for design wins with PSG products across many of Intel's businesses.",".

What is the ""industry enthusiasm building for our ground-breaking new memory technology, 3D Crosspoint?""
What is the ""programmable solutions group, formerly Altera, was up 6% on strength in wireline, industrial, and broadcast segments?""
What is the ""integration of Altera into Intel"" doing?
What is the ""deal thesis"" for PSG?
What is the ""results after adjusting for acquisition-related accounting charges"" for PSG?
What is the ""industry's first and only 14-nanometer FPGA?"""
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: PSG's results show the tremendous progress and execution.
The Intel security business was up 6% over last year. Last month we announced that we will sell 51% of Intel security to private equity firm TPG, and establish a jointly-owned, independent cybersecurity Company named McAfee. This transaction will position McAfee to invest as an independent Company while allowing Intel to continue to participate in McAfee's success and growth.
Intel's transformation continues and the restructuring program that we've announced in April remains on track. I'm really proud of the work our employees are doing to accelerate our strategy. A change of this magnitude is hard, and going through it has again reinforced just how talented, committed, and resilient this team is.
And finally, I'd like to welcome Bob to the Company as our Chief Financial Officer.",".

Q: What is the name of the cybersecurity company that Intel will sell a 51% stake in?
A: The name of the cybersecurity company that Intel will sell a 51% stake in is McAfee."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: He brings a wealth of leadership experience to Intel, and his financial acumen and strategic insights will be an asset to the Company.
At the same time, I'd like to thank Stacy for an outstanding nine years as CFO. He's been a great partner, and I'm excited to have his leadership in manufacturing, sales, and operations moving forward.
Wrapping things up, I'm very pleased with our results in the third quarter. We introduced exciting new products, delivered strong financials, and continued to realign our resources to our strategy. The progress we're making leaves me increasingly confident in our transformation. With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.                                         
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - EVP of Manufacturing, Sales, and Operations    [4]
                                        
Thanks, Brian.",".

What is Intel's strategy?

Intel's strategy is to focus on delivering products that are innovative and valuable to customers."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: In the third quarter, we achieved record revenue of $15.8 billion, and also achieved $5.1 billion in operating income. Revenue growth of 9% year over year is driven by solid growth across the client computing, data center, and Internet of Things groups.
Gross margin at 64.8% was higher than expected, and up 3 points from the second quarter. Operating income grew 18% from a year ago. Earnings per share of $0.80 were up $0.14 from a year ago.
The client computing group had revenue of $8.9 billion, up 5% year over year During the third quarter, we saw strengthening of demand and an inventory build in the worldwide PC supply chain.",".

Question: What was the main driver of revenue growth in the third quarter?
Answer: The main driver of revenue growth in the third quarter was strong growth across the client computing, data center, and Internet of Things groups."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: This segment had another quarter of significant profit growth, with operating profit growing 37% from a year ago as revenue increased, costs came down, and investment levels declined.
The data center group had record revenue of $4.5 billion, up 10% year over year. In the third quarter, we continue to see robust growth in the cloud segment of the business, which grew over 30% year over year, partially offset by a 3% decline in enterprise segment over the same horizon. The data center group had operating profit of $2.1 billion, down 1% year over year, as we increased investments and ramp Broadwell, the first 14-nanometer server product.
Our Internet of Things business achieved revenue of $689 million, growing 19% year over year, driven by strength in our retail, video, and transportation segments.",".

What is the company's revenue growth rate for the third quarter?
The company's revenue growth rate for the third quarter was 10%."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Operating profit for the business was $191 million, up 27% year over year.
Our memory business had revenue of $649 million, down 1% year over year. This segment had an operating loss of $134 million as a result of start-up costs for our China factory and costs associated with 3D Crosspoint.
The programmable solutions group had revenue of $425 million, up 6% when compared to Altera's results from a year ago. Operating profit was $78 million.
Our security business had revenue of $537 million, up 6% from a year ago. In the third quarter, we announced a newly formed, jointly owned, independent cybersecurity Company called McAfee.",".

What was the company's operating profit for the business? $191 million"
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: The transaction values the business at approximately $4.2 billion, and at deal close, we expect to realize a pretax gain on this sale of roughly $500 million when the transaction closes in the second quarter of 2017.
The costs associated with the transaction are factored into our restructuring and spending guide. Post deal close, we will own 49% of the new Company.
We are generating healthy levels of free cash flow, which enables us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders.",".

Question: What is the pretax gain on the sale of the business?
Answer: The pretax gain on the sale of the business is $500 million."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: This is demonstrated in our third-quarter results, as we generated $5.8 billion of cash from operations, purchased $2.5 billion in capital assets, repaid $1 billion in commercial paper, repurchased approximately $500 million of stock, and paid $1.2 billion in dividends.
As we look forward to the fourth quarter of 2016, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $15.7 billion, roughly flat to the third quarter. This is below the average seasonal increase for the fourth quarter, as we expect the worldwide PC supply chain to reduce the inventory.
Since the last earnings call, our view of second-half 2016 revenue has increased, as a result of strength in the client computing and Internet of Things groups, partially offset by weakness in the enterprise segment of the data center.",".

What is the midpoint of the revenue range for Intel Corp in the fourth quarter?
The midpoint of the revenue range is $15.7 billion."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We are now forecasting the midpoint of the fourth-quarter gross margin to be 63%. Spending is expected to be approximately $5.2 billion.
Intel is in the midst of a significant transformation. We are focusing on being more efficient, investing in higher growth segments, and with the McAfee transaction, we are focusing our business on core strategic areas. Given that, I would like to provide a little more context on each.
We are on track to achieve the run-rate savings and employment reductions associated with the restructuring program announced earlier this year, and in fact, we are moving faster than we anticipated.",".

Question: What is the run-rate savings and employment reductions associated with the restructuring program announced earlier this year?
Answer: The run-rate savings and employment reductions associated with the restructuring program announced earlier this year are approximately $1.5 billion and 1,500 jobs, respectively."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: In addition, the deal involving the Intel security group, which was announced in the third quarter, will result in additional restructuring charges, a pretax gain, and reduced spending levels in 2017.
As a result of those restructuring charges, and the increased mix of retirements and European severances, we are increasing the restructuring and other charges forecast by $700 million to $2.3 billion. The majority of the remaining restructuring charges will be realized between now and the middle of 2017.
We are on track to the original restructuring and focusing our business on core strategic areas. This is allowing incremental investments in critical areas like the data center, Internet of Things, and memory.",".

What is the ""Pretax gain"" from the Intel security group deal?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: The overall impact of the announced reductions, Intel security group transaction, and reinvestment is that we expect our 2016 spending as a percent of revenue to be down almost 1 point versus 2015, and we expect to achieve another 1 point reduction in 2017 as we accelerate our transformation.
In the third quarter, we achieved record revenue and strong operating profit. But since this is my last earnings call, I would like to take the opportunity to provide some historical perspective on how the Company has changed over the 10 years since I've been attending these calls, which I really think shows the transformation of our business.
Ten years ago, virtually the entirety of our business was tied to the PC market.",".

What was the PC market in 2006?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Today, we have a diversified portfolio of growing businesses with roughly half of our profits coming from the data center and Internet of Things businesses.
We are also a different Company in terms of how we look financially. Ten years ago, our revenue was approximately $35 billion with a gross margin of 52%. In 2016, we're on a path to almost $59 billion in revenue with a gross margin of 63%. Over the past 10 years, we've increased our dividend from $0.40 per share to $1.04 per share, and we've repurchased about $55 billion of stock.
Looking forward, Intel is positioned with technology leadership, an amazing workforce, and significant market opportunity as we power the cloud at the heart of all of these smart and connected devices.",".

What is the gross margin for Intel in 2016? 63%."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: I am excited about how we're positioned for growth and my next role in the Company, and about the leadership, experience, and continued focus on driving long-term shareholder value that Bob will bring as CFO. With that, let me turn it over to Bob for a few words.                                         
Bob Swan,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [5]
                                        
Thanks, Stacy, and thanks, Brian. I am both excited and very honored to be joining the team at Intel. The Company has had a profound impact on the world with industry-leading technologies, it has a great business model driven by Moore's Law, and an outstanding balance sheet. Additionally, I'm inheriting a top-notch, world-class finance organization.
It's an extremely exciting time in the Company's history, as we transition from a PC-centric Company to one that powers the cloud in billions of smart connected devices.",".

Q1. What are the key areas of focus for the finance organization during this transition?
A. The finance organization will focus on developing and executing a long-term capital allocation strategy, as well as providing financial support to the business units that make up Intel."

Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. First question on DCG, you took the number down for Q4. Curious how we should think about contribution from enterprise looking into 2017, when you think that could stabilize.",". 

Intel Corporation - Head of IR

We expect enterprise to continue to be a key driver of our growth in 2017, as they continue to invest in new products and services. We expect our enterprise business to contribute approximately 50% of our total revenue in 2017."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And then as you start to think about greater contributions from hyperscale and networking, is that 10% to 15% sustainable or should we be thinking high single digits going forward? Thank you.                                         
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - EVP of Manufacturing, Sales, and Operations    [3]
                                        
Hi, CJ. This is Stacy. So, let me take the first part of that question. So yes, as we just said on the call, what we're seeing in the data center is very strong growth rates in the cloud, very strong growth rates in networking and storage, as those areas become virtualized and our products extend into those areas. And then we saw some weakness in the enterprise in Q4   or Q3, and that's what we're expecting for Q4.
I think we're going to hold off on providing a forecast for 2017 at this time.",".

What is Intel's outlook for cloud, networking, and storage growth in 2017?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We would normally provide that to you in January, and then have a much more in-depth conversation in the investor meeting in February.                                         
C.J. Muse,  Evercore ISI - Analyst    [4]
                                        
Okay. Very helpful. And on the PC front, given the volatility there, I wouldn't expect you guys to put the flag down and say that we've completely stabilized. But curious what trends you can speak to in terms of growth, perhaps, in emerging markets and what that speaks to in terms of the trajectory for unit demand from here.                                         
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [5]
                                        
Sure, and I would agree, we're not going to raise the flag and say everything's good again. If you take a look at this quarter, what we saw was an increased strength in the areas that have been strong in the past.",".

Q1 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We would normally provide that to you in January, and then have a much more in-depth conversation in the investor meeting in February."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So definitely the mature markets were a bit stronger. The one that was probably a little bit of a shift is China, it was a little bit better than we had forecasted as well.
Enterprise was again strong. Consumer was better, but it's still not back to where we consider it   where we'd like to see the consumer side. And it was a good mix between desktop and mobile products, laptops, and two-in-ones and devices like that. So it was an increase in what's been strong in the past is really what drove the growth for this quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please.",".

What is Intel's outlook for the PC market in the second half of 2016?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call:                                         
Stacy Rasgon,  Bernstein Research - Analyst    [8]
                                        
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, DCG revenue's up 10% year over year. Operating profit down year over year. I know you had highlighted some increased investments. But we also have cloud growth and networking and some of the other non-CPU stuff that's been growing as well.
How should we think about that change in the growth drivers in terms of impacting the margins over the last year? And how should we think about the likely margin trends for the business as we go into next year?                                         
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - EVP of Manufacturing, Sales, and Operations    [9]
                                        
I'll take that, and then Brian may want to talk about more of the longer term. It's not a driver in what we saw in the third quarter.",".

What is the impact of increased investments on margins?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: There really are the two issues. We have been very consciously increasing investment there. We see a tremendous long-term opportunity, so that's been an ongoing process for us.
But then the thing that really kicked in this quarter is they're ramping their first 14-nanometer server product, which is Broadwell for the server market, and that   those first products coming out on that product line are fairly expensive.
To the mix question, it doesn't really drive things probably as much as you would expect. We have very strong product margins across the portfolio of server products in the enterprise or in the data center, ranging from enterprise to storage to networking. And in fact, when we look at the server ASPs, we actually saw ASPs up across the board in every one of our server categories, so NP, DP.",".

Question: What is the main reason for the increase in investment in the data center?
Answer: The main reason for the increase in investment in the data center is the tremendous long-term opportunity."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And so it really is a mix impact of what you see happening this quarter, where it was a little weaker on enterprise and a little stronger in places like networking.                                         
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [10]
                                        
Stacy, maybe   this is Brian. Maybe let me help you just think about the data center from a larger perspective, right. As Stacy said, what you have to really take a look here is the growth areas that we said we were going to continue to grow in, the cloud service provider, the telco space, the networking and storage, networking specifically is some of our fastest growing areas of the data center.",".

1. What is the CEO's response to Stacy's comment about the weaker performance in enterprise products?
2. What is the CEO's response to Stacy's comment about the stronger performance in networking products?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And in the adjacencies, which are all new, emerging markets for us around things like Silicon Photonics and Omni-Path fabric and all, all of those are growing at or above what we had forecasted. And doing quite well.
And as Stacy said, across each of those, our ASPs are both increasing. And if you take a look at that, even if you go down to like an Atom server, the Atom-based server, yes, their ASPs are lower, but the margins are still quite healthy down there because their costs are quite a bit lower.",".

Question: What are the margins on Intel's Atom-based servers?
Answer: The margins on Intel's Atom-based servers are quite healthy, as they are cost-effective compared to other server types."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So you've got to keep all of that into perspective as you look at the mix that goes across these.
What happened this quarter is that we had anticipated the Enterprise to go from that low single-digit decline to roughly flat, and it just hasn't   the enterprise market hasn't shored up there yet. We're working on tactics to shore that up over the next couple quarters, and we're still very convinced on the long-term path of   that those growth areas that we described are going to be what drives the data center.

Thank you. For my follow-up, I'd like to touch on the last point you just made. So enterprise is, like you said, disappointing this quarter.",".

What is Intel's strategy to shore up the enterprise market?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: But let's be honest, enterprise has been in decline for years.
Why would it stabilize? What would it start growing? Why is the   I know we probably talked about this before, but why isn't the cloud grout that we're seeing in the enterprise indicative of that cloud growth? I don't understand why we should expect that business to ever turn around. Can you give us some color on that?                                         
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [12]
                                        
Sure. I think there's two parts to this. Certainly a certain amount of the enterprise weakness, right, that has occurred over the last few years is certainly driven by movement of those enterprise applications to the cloud. And we're very comfortable.",".

What is Intel's opinion on the cloud's impact on enterprise?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: It doesn't really matter for us, from a product definition or product performance standpoint, whether it goes   those applications go to the cloud or whether they stay in the enterprise.
That said, there's several enterprises that we are in talks with that all want to grow their own private clouds, and they're really looking at how best to do that, when do they do that. So I think it's more the customer feedback we're getting that gives us some confidence that the enterprise side, with their own private clouds, will continue to see some improvement.
It's not going to be a growth area, though, so don't take this as I'm saying, Stacy, that this is going to be a growth segment.",".

What is Intel's strategy for growing its private cloud business?"

So first question is, again, staying on the data center theme, can you quantify the enterprise mix in DCG now? And is that required to be flat in order to maintain the double-digit growth in DCG or can it actually start growing double digit if the growth in other areas remains at this current pace, just because of the mix effect?                                         
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - EVP of Manufacturing, Sales, and Operations    [19]
                                        
So let me take a shot at the quantification question.",".

What is the enterprise mix in Intel's Data Center Group?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And again, I think we'll   Brian talked about this bullishness on the long term for the data center, but we'll hold off on specific CAGRs and 2017 forecasts to both earnings and then the investor meeting.
On the   I think you're referring back to what I showed a year ago, which was the size of the enterprise versus the size of the data center for the   or size of the cloud for the server segment of DCG and that we were heading towards a crossover between those. Again, we'll update that explicitly come February.",".

Question: What is the size of the enterprise versus the size of the data center for the Intel Corp?
Answer: The size of the enterprise is larger than the size of the data center."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: But based on what we've seen this year with really robust growth still occurring in the cloud, so again, this quarter over 30% and a weaker than expected enterprise, I think that crossover point pulls in.
And then I think you have a phenomenon that says the cloud portion of the enterprise becomes so big and continues to grow at a fast pace that we can certainly maintain a robust growth rate, even if the enterprise segment is not growing to slightly weak.                                         
Vivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [20]
                                        
And as my follow-up, a longer-term question. I think there's a debate in the industry that computation is becoming more parallel with this growth in deep learning and machine learning, which benefits products like GPUs more than CPUs."," that supports that view.

What is your view on the role of CPUs and GPUs in this growth?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: I'm wondering, would you agree with that and do you think this parallel computing market is incremental or cannibalistic for Intel?                                         
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [21]
                                        
Sure, so first, to your first question, I 100% agree with what Stacy said. And I expect that these growing segments, that's why we focus on them so much and will be the dominant as we move out into the later parts of this decade.
Your question on accelerators really is what you're asking when you take a look at GPUs and things like deep learning.",".

1. What is Intel's opinion on the parallel computing market?
2. What is Intel's opinion on the accelerators market?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: The first thing you have to separate out is things like is  are you talking about the deep learning on the learning portion or the scoring portion? So we don't look at accelerators as cannibalistic, because you still have to have a Xeon system with those when you go to actually do the implementation of the deep learning application.
The second thing we tell you is that we actually had worked over the last two years or so to really implement a much broader collection of accelerators, when you think about these. If you want to think about the rates of performance of each one of these, you have FPGAs which are accelerators, and we see those accelerators go into everything from networking devices to machine learning applications.",".

What is the rate of performance for FPGAs?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Those have high levels of flexibility that can be programmed on the fly, but maybe not quite the performance.
Then you have GPUs. GPUs do have, as you say, good accelerating performance in certain linear algorithms. Those are quite good, and we have our Xeon Phi in that space.
And then the highest performance area are ASICs, where they're very workload-specific and designed around the algorithm specifically, and you saw our applications of Nervana. We also did an acquisition of Movidius earlier this quarter. Those are all very specific workloads around machine learning that are ASIC-driven and even give higher performance.
So we look at those accelerators as being enhancing this growth. You sell a Xeon typically with that so it doesn't cannibalize the business.",".

What is the difference between GPUs and ASICs?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We believe we have the lightest really offerings of these accelerators from FPGAs through the Xeon Phi and then into ASIC-driven devices.

Thanks for taking my question. My first one is on gross margins. In your Q4 guide, you have memory and higher factory start-up costs on 10-nanometer working against you. But I was curious when you would expect these items to fade and potentially provide a tailwind to gross margins.                                         
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - EVP of Manufacturing, Sales, and Operations    [25]
                                        
So this is Stacy. That's a good question.",".                                                

Q: When do you expect the higher factory start-up costs to fade and provide a tailwind to gross margins?
A: We expect the higher factory start-up costs to fade in the second half of 2016."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So typically, on the shape of start-up costs, you would expect that 10-nanometer costs go up in the back half of this year, as you're seeing. They stay high into the first two to three quarters of next year, and then they start to fall off in the back half of next year. So I'll just stick with that for now and then leave it to Bob to show you the start-up cost trends, as he thinks that that's important.
On the memory costs, what you're seeing is really two impacts. One is the start-up costs associated with Dalian, or China, factory for memory, and then some of the first wafers coming out for 3D NAND and 3-D Crosspoint. And I'd expect that that starts to get better into next year.",".

What is the start-up cost for the Dalian factory for memory?"

Toshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [26]
                                        
Okay. Great. As my follow-up, I have a question on CapEx as well. Based on your annual guide, I think the implied Q4 number is close to $3.5 billion, which is clearly a pretty big number. Should we take this as a new normal for Intel, or is this a one-off quarter where you're spending aggressively in both the core business and in memory and that the quarterly run rate going forward should revert to somewhere in the $2 billion to $2.5 billion range? Thank you.",".

I think if you go back to the guide at the   I think we probably talked about it some time prior April, that I pointed to Q4 as probably being a pretty high CapEx quarter. And it's the combination of where we're at in purchasing the first production set for 10-nanometer and where we're at with the memory factory in China. So I think you're seeing some lumpiness here. I wouldn't run rate that out.

Hi, guys, thanks for letting me ask the question. My first question is just relative to what's embedded within PCs for the calendar fourth quarter.",". What is the run rate for PCs in the fourth quarter? 

Intel Corporation: We expect our annualized run rate for this year to be the $9.5 billion or so that we forecasted, and don't expect that quarterly run rate to be indicative of Q4."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: It's getting a little bit more difficult to track because of CCG, including the mobile. And if you look at the volume growth in the September quarter, it was clearly above normal seasonal trends for the core PC business.

Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - EVP of Manufacturing, Sales, and Operations    [33]
                                        
I'd say from an end-market standpoint, it's pretty seasonal. And then from our business, it's the impact that Brian and I both talked about, which is we saw some strengthening of demand in the third quarter. We saw some refilling of the pipeline, which was lean coming in.",".

Question: How much below seasonal do you think PCs will be in the calendar fourth quarter, and how are you guys thinking about the inventory channel management in Q4?

Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And then in Q4, we're expecting seasonal end demand but some depletion of inventory pipeline.
And it doesn't take much. If you think about the size of the PC market, you're down to changes in inventory levels across the worldwide PC supply chain that are measured in days or certainly less than a week of inventory that shifts around.

Hi, guys. My first question's on the CCG side of things. Specifically, in the third quarter, you talked about the ASPs year over year in desktops and notebooks and then overall. I think the ASPs were up 6% in CCG, but the desktop and notebook side were both well below that."," on why that might be.

We think that the mix of products in CCG was a bit more weighted towards lower-priced products in the third quarter. We saw some good progress in the high-end PC market and we're seeing some good progress in the gaming market. So we think that the mix of products was a bit more weighted towards those higher-priced products.

Yes, that's a great question. So yes, you   and we published what we saw happen in notebook and desktop ASPs. The piece that's missing, and it's relatively small, but it has a fairly big impact on the average is that within the phone and tablet products, we saw relatively less volume in Q4, so we got   or Q3, sorry, we got some mix effect. And that ASP is up dramatically on a year-on-year basis as a result of the abatement of the contra revenue program. So that's the missing piece you need to get to the overall platform ASP math.",".

Great, and as a follow-up, switching over to the OpEx side of things. Stacy, in your script, you mentioned about the OpEx to revenue improving by about 1 point this year, year over year, and then again, another 1 point next year. Can you just walk us through a little bit about what that means, either from a linearity perspective or an absolute dollar perspective. Any more color would be appreciated.                                         
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - EVP of Manufacturing, Sales, and Operations    [42]
                                        
Sure. I'd be happy to do that. So let me just   let me take you all the way back to   because I think this gets very confusing, because we obviously had the restructuring program in place. We now have the spinout or the divestiture, excuse me, of the Intel security business.",". So, the question is, how does that impact OpEx? The answer is that it impacts OpEx by reducing OpEx by about $1 billion this year and then by about $1.5 billion next year."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: The timing of those things will play out differently over the course of next year. So I just thought it was best to clean all of this up and give you one metric for the year that summarizes everything.
And so starting with restructuring, it's on track. When you look at the savings that we've already generated this year, really the only adjustment to the spending guide that we've made when we started the restructuring is the fact that profits and revenue is up, and we have some profit and revenue-dependent spending.
You can see we're over three quarters saving on the order of $700 million. You can think of that as an annualized run rate of a little north of $1 billion of savings that then rolls into next year. Then we'll get some incremental savings.",".

Question: What is the annualized run rate of savings from restructuring?
Answer: The annualized run rate of savings from restructuring is $1 billion."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We throw McAfee into the mix here, and we're going to make some reinvestments, as we've talked about in some of the areas that are important, think of data center and IoT and memory.
And so when you add all that up, to just give you an all-in number that captures the full calendar 2017, what we're expecting is that from the starting point of 2015, we're down about 1 point in 2016, and then we should be down on the order of another 1 point next year in 2017 with all of this all in, the restructuring, McAfee, and the reinvestment. I hope that helped.

Thanks, guys. Just on the PC, you guys were pretty much first to call the inventory burn in Q1 of this year. In terms of your call for inventory burn in the PC channel for Q4, is this reflected in your order book? Is this what your customers and channel partners are telling you? Or is this you guys think that, hey, things were a little too good in Q3 so they have to ease up a little bit in Q4?

So it's never a guess on our part. It's always some combination of that data set that is what the OEMs tell us, what we see in retail and our discussions with retail, and even just our own   we go out and collect that data in the retail space of what people are doing, what's the basically population density at a place like Best Buy? How many people are out there buying PCs versus something else in the store? We compile all that data to give that forecast.

I would just add, the order book is much less meaningful than it used to be, because in many cases, we hold inventory at a hub at our customer's location. The cancellation policy is such that they only pull demand when they need it. We have policies to make sure we're not creating false incentives for them to take demand they don't want.",".

Yes, it came in pretty much right where I was expecting, Chris. What we saw is a reduction in CPU inventory in the third quarter, and even within that, a pretty sizable reduction in first-generation 14-nanometer products being replaced by second-generation 14-nanometer products.",".

And then, we're still on track. I was looking at the   what we're expecting from a sales standpoint, and what we're expecting from overall builds and yields and everything else, we're still on track to have inventory come down in Q4, which is what I signaled on the last call.

Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Just want to circle back on DCG, just when you look at the way September played out and as you look into December, was enterprise really the only area that changed?

Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [54]
                                        
Yes, it absolutely did. We tried to talk about the numbers in the preview to the start of just showing you by segment there, cloud, telco, networking and storage, and then the adjacencies. They all grew at or above our forecast.
Those are still, as we talked about earlier in one of the questions, growing in a percentage of our overall data center business.",".

What was the main reason for the growth in enterprise?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So they weren't quite enough to offset the 3 percentage decline in the enterprise side. But absolutely, that was the story for the quarter.
We're quite happy, and I think our thesis of what continues to drive their growth is holding. When we go out and talk to our partners and customers about what's driving cloud growth, what's going to drive the networking and storage requirements out in time, we start to look at devices like autonomous cars and the IoT network in general, all of those things are driving large requirements into those data centers in those growth segments. And so that's what gives us the comfort that, yes, this will continue. And our forecasts are holding in those spaces.

Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: The yields are quite good; they're as good as our existing factories.
So you'll see that factory now ramp through the first half, roughly, of next year, and as most of that spending will occur in that same time frame as far as adding the equipment to facilitate that ramp. From there then, it's just purely just running the volume and continuing to grow in that space. That's primarily 3D NAND. Again, we believe we have cost performance that is quite good relative to the rest of the market.
With the 3-D Crosspoint, we are in the process of shipping samples now to customers by the   as we go through this quarter, we'll ship thousands of samples to customers.",".

Let me   I'll hit on the margin, but I do want to do a shout-out to the China factory team. I was just out there and Brian was being a little humble. The yields on their first production material matched the yields on the mature production facility, which is a phenomenal result for a factory. So they're doing quite well.
In terms of the overall margin, if you look at the   let's just focus on Q3.",".

What is the margin for Q3? The margin for Q3 is $0.10."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: What we saw in Q3 is an improvement in the underlying NAND business being offset by increased start-up costs associated with Dalian, China, and some increased costs associated with 3-D Crosspoint.
As Brian said, when we get into the first half of next year, those products are ramping. And so we should start to see pretty significant improvements in the overall P&L because that headwind, if you will, goes away and we have a very competitive, very cost competitive product line that we're selling in the marketplace.

2. We're looking for real features that drive Skylake performance."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: What we find is that each one of these generations, as long as you stay on this cost-performance curve, people are willing to go buy those that are running these cloud platforms quite quickly.
And so we're seeing demand for Broadwell from the cloud service providers, from the networking and telco side, and quite strong. So we don't think we see   if we were going to see performance-based cannibalization, you'd see it in those real high-level performance sectors first actually, I would think. So we don't see that.
On the Purley platform, we're actually starting to sample those products already to some of the leading-edge customers. And they're seeing not only just an overall TCO performance advantage that we typically see with each one of these, but this also continues our integration of things like the Omni-Path fabric.",".

What do you think is the main reason that people are still willing to buy Intel processors that are running on the cloud platforms?

Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: It has more integration of the Silicon Photonics. So it's those adjacency functions that are quite strong as you   and they will get more and better as we go through each one of these.
There will be a second generation of Purley that includes 3-D Crosspoint. It allows pooling of memory, and then there will be future ones that allow additional pooling of things like FPGAs. So each one of these now adds some additional features across the rack that really helps in the overall system performance.

First, I do want to recognize that our OEM partners are putting out some great products, and I think you're going to have to take a look at this and really ask   that's a pretty interesting scenario and I'm very hesitant to this. But typically, Stacy's right.",".

What would be the expected fall-through in CPU ASPs if ultrabooks experienced a 10% increase in ASP?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: If ASPs go up across the board at the system level, it tends to float all boats.
So our OEM partners would see an increase. We'd see an increase. The other partners within that infrastructure would see it. We really more think of our pricing, though, as value-based. So as we bring out new products and bring out new features, we make sure that the value-based pricing is there and that people are either getting more value for the same price or quite a bit more for a slightly increased price.
So I think that's such a unique scenario, as it just over, across the board, all of the sudden one day prices go up, actually, we wouldn't necessarily flow through that ASP to our end partners because we didn't necessarily drive that from a new features.",".

What would happen if ASPs went up across the board at the system level?

This would likely cause an increase in prices for our customers, as well as an increase in profits for Intel. Our OEM partners would see an increase, as would other partners within the infrastructure that Intel provides. We believe that our value-based pricing is important, and we make sure to maintain a high level of value for our customers by introducing new products and features with increased prices as needed."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: If it happens with our 10-nanometer launch and it's because of features, then we do add those. So we do it based on what value we provide to the end user and our OEM partners.                                         
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - EVP of Manufacturing, Sales, and Operations    [68]
                                        
And if I can just add, the way we would see that is actually with a mixing up. We don't raise our pricing. But the way you articulated this, if it's a bunch of high-end notebook ultrathins, thin and lights, we would see a mixing up of our overall demand. And in fact, it is one of the phenomenons that we've been seeing. I think we've done a good job of creating a differentiated product line. And this quarter, we saw great sales of I-7s and notebooks.",".

What do you think is the reason for the increase in demand for ultrathins notebooks this quarter?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And so I think it's consistent with what you're seeing in your channels.                                         
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [69]
                                        
Probably the best example of that is the gaming space. We continue to see   we put out the [case] SKU, a 12-core monster, and we wonder how many people are going to go buy it and we find we're sold out. So I think that's an example where, quote, our ASPs go up but it's really a mix function. Otherwise, it's going to be   we always just do pricing based on value and features that we bring.                                         
Chris Rolland,  Susquehanna Financial Group - Analyst    [70]
                                        
Great. Thanks for the detail.                                         
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [71]
                                        
Operator, I think we have time for two more questioners.",".

Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call:

And so I think it's consistent with what you're seeing in your channels. What are some of the other areas where you see ASPs going up but it's really a mix function?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call:                                         
Operator    [72]
                                        
Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen & Company. Your question, please.                                         
Timothy Arcuri,  Cowen & Company - Analyst    [73]
                                        
Thank you very much. My first question is, I think you had said at the spring analyst meeting that the enterprise would be a little bit less than half of DCG this year, revenue-wise. Can you right-size us on what enterprise will be as a percentage of DCG just in the fourth quarter?                                         
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - EVP of Manufacturing, Sales, and Operations    [74]
                                        
This is Stacy. I think I took a stab at this earlier, but let me just reiterate what I said. To be clear, I was talking CPUs, enterprise server CPUs.",".                                    

Q: What percentage of Intel's total revenue will the enterprise segment be in the fourth quarter?
A: The enterprise segment will be approximately 49% of total revenue in the fourth quarter."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And so if you take the slides that I showed back a year ago, we've seen robust growth rates in the cloud. We've seen less-than-expected growth rates in the enterprise. So if anything, we've pulled in those crossover points.
Beyond that, we haven't given a new percentage, and that would be something that we would logically talk about when we give the longer-term perspective to the market in this coming February investor meeting.                                         
Timothy Arcuri,  Cowen & Company - Analyst    [75]
                                        
Got it. Okay. And then I want to ask a question on the mobile losses. I know that you don't break out MCG anymore. But I think I asked you last call about feeling good about this $800 million improvement in losses this year.",".

What is your outlook for MCG losses in 2016? And what is your outlook for the $800 million improvement in losses this year?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: That would get you to roughly a loss of 2.2 to 2.3 in the former MCG.
Can you talk in light of the iPhone win, can you talk maybe how you think about the degree to which you could get further improvement in that number next year? Thanks.                                         
Stacy Smith,  Intel Corporation - EVP of Manufacturing, Sales, and Operations    [76]
                                        
Sure. So first off, let me just say as is our standard practice, we don't talk about our customer   what technology they use inside their products in this space. So I'm not going to confirm or anything on a particular win. But I'll take you back to the mobile loss here.
So as you got right, we no longer have a mobile segment; we haven't for a while.",".

1. What is Intel's standard practice for not talking about customer technology?
2. How long has Intel not had a mobile segment?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We had articulated that in 2015 we expected to improve the loss by $800 million. We actually ended up closer to $1 billion.
We said, hey, based on everything we know of what's going on with contra revenue and investments and margin improvements and all of that, that we'd expect something on the order of an $800 million improvement in 2016. Everything I know from there would say we're on track or exceeding that, just because we know that as we've gone through our restructuring, we've made some further disinvestments. We've, as you just heard earlier, our volume's a little lower, our contra revenue's looking a little lower, the product margins all look good.
So I'm not seeing anything that would say it's smaller. If anything, it's going to be bigger in terms of the overall savings.",".

Question: What is the expected improvement in 2016?
Answer: We expect an improvement of $800 million."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And I do just want to reiterate, it's impossible for us to detangle it going forward. Where you really see this is in the CCG operating results, and as we started this call, they had phenomenal operating margins this quarter. And everything went right. They had revenue growth. They saw unit costs coming down. They're making, I think, prudent disinvestment decisions. When you add all that up, they become a real cash and profit driver for the Company.                                         
Timothy Arcuri,  Cowen & Company - Analyst    [77]
                                        
Thank you.                                         
Operator    [78]
                                        
Thank you. Our final question then comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your question, please.                                         
Harlan Sur,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [79]
                                        
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the IoT business, it's good to see the reacceleration in growth.",".                                    

What was the main driver of growth in the IoT business?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Can you just talk about the sustainability of the double-digits year-over-year growth trends and the sustainability of the 20%-plus operating margins on a go-forward basis? I know you mentioned broad-based strength across the verticals. Maybe you can just also talk about some of the product segments that are powering this growth.                                         
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [80]
                                        
Yes, sure. So I'm trying to make sure I really think about what question you're asking. From a   can we sustain the double-digit growth? We absolutely believe that we can, and we've tested that with our   the deals that we see on the plate going forward. So we've forward tested that.
And we've looked at our product road maps and what we're bringing out.",".

What are some of the product segments that are powering this growth?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And we've got products like Atlas Peak and Atlas Peak 2 that are coming that are Broxton-based products that are quite strong and quite capable in this segment, and priced and designed right for that.
The segments are going to continue to believe   be, we believe, the video analytics segment; that continues to go well. There are other segments of the industrial segment that we believe will continue to grow on machine automation, machine factory automation, think of it as factory automation.
The retail segment will continue to be an area where it continues to grow. And then automotive, and you saw us make deals, for example, this quarter with BMW on autonomous driving, which is a little further out.",".

Question: What are the segments that Intel believes will continue to grow?
Answer: The segments that Intel believes will continue to grow are the video analytics segment, the industrial segment, the retail segment, and the automotive segment."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: But that's just an example.
You'll also see products from Land Rover and a variety of other OEMs that are a mix of everything from autonomous driving programs to in-vehicle infotainment-type systems. And those systems are quite   we're thinking of them more and more as servers on wheels, as you start looking at all of the adjacencies too. They're needing connectivity. They're needing storage. They're needing Silicon Photonics for moving the infotainment, basically the graphics video around the system. They use FPGAs for accelerators, like we talked about earlier.
So when we look across those segments and we test it out, we do believe we can continue that. Those are also high compute areas, and it's what gives us the confidence in the margin functions as well.",".

What is Intel's strategy for in-vehicle infotainment systems?
Intel plans to continue developing in-vehicle infotainment systems as servers on wheels that require connectivity, storage, and Silicon Photonics for graphics video. This strategy gives the company confidence in its margin functions."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: They tend to reuse a lot of our intellectual property from the PC segment and carry that down over into it. That's one of the real strengths of Intel's integrated device manufacturing business model.
And so the amount of investment required to bring those to market are less than if you start from scratch and that's your only product. That's what gives us the confidence in the margin space as well.                                         
Harlan Sur,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [81]
                                        
Great, and then thanks for the insights there. On the cellular modem front, obviously the team is driving good success here with the 7360 this year. Looks like you guys are continuing to drive the road maps.
I notice that your next-generation platform, the 7480, was just qualified at AT&T just this month.",".

What is the margin outlook for cellular modems?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: This was actually about the same time last year that you guys qualified the 7360 at AT&T. Now that it's qualified, can you just help us understand when should we expect 7480 to show up in mobile devices? Would this be 2017, and any other color you can provide us in terms of other global carriers that you've qualified this new chip set with?                                         
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [82]
                                        
Sure. So I think you really want to think the modem space as really an annual cadence. I think that's what it's taking us a while to get to is to get to that annual pace. But we really believe we're on a clip now. As you said, the 7480 is now qualified. As you said, it's qualified at AT&T there.
We typically go then out and around the world.",".

Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call:

Brian Krzanich, Intel Corporation - CEO

So I think you really want to think the modem space as really an annual cadence. I think that's what it's taking us a while to get to is to get to that annual pace. But we really believe we're on a clip now. As you said, the 7480 is now qualified. As you said, it's qualified at AT&T there.

We typically go then out and around the world."
Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So you'll see it at many of the same places that the 7360 got qualified, in Europe, in China, other parts of southeast Asia. So those will be ongoing now.
And you should just think about we're really targeting modem technology advancements on that annual basis, and typically, you're right; they get qualified in the third and fourth quarter of the year before. And then customers start to roll out those devices, typically, more towards the second half of the following year. So you should see these things start to show up in devices in the second half of 2017.
And you should just think about that from this business from here on. We should come out with another series next year at this time with the 2018 target. That's really our business model for the modems moving forward.",".

What is Intel Corp's business model for modems moving forward?
Intel Corp's business model for modems moving forward is to generate one new series of modems each year."

                                                   Thank you, Crystal, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com.
I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Bob Swan, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, does include risks and uncertainties.",".

1. What risks and uncertainties are included in today's forward-looking statements?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
A brief reminder that this quarter we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we'll be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The CFO commentary and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations.
And finally, I'd like to draw your attention to a change we've made to our guidance practices for the current quarter and full year. Beginning with today's earnings release for the first quarter of 2017, our business outlook will speak only as of the date of our quarterly earnings releases, bringing our practices in line with virtually all of our peers.

What is the non-GAAP financial measure that Intel will be referring to when discussing its consolidated results?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO and Director     [3]
                                                   Thanks, Mark. The first quarter marked a great start to the year. Coming off both Q4 and full year records in 2016, Q1 revenue was up 7% over the first quarter of last year, a record Q1. And operating margin was up 20%. It was another milestone in our transformation from a PC-centric company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart and connected devices. Average selling prices or ASPs grew meaningfully across our PC, data center and IoT business, reflecting the market's demand for performance and our segmentation strategy. And our memory business set an all-time record revenue.

That's the framework we're using to measure our success throughout the year, and I'd like to take a few minutes to assess our progress so far.
First, the data center and its adjacencies. DCG grew 6% year-over-year despite a headwind resulting from a 14-week first quarter last year. The cloud service provider revenue was up 18%. The comms service provider segment was up 12%. And enterprise was down 3%, while non-CPU adjacencies grew more than 20% across all of the segments.",".

Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: This trend, along with our ramping modem business, drove revenue up 6% and operating margin up 60% over last year. Our expectations for the PC unit TAM haven't changed since we last talked with you. We're expecting a mid-single-digit percentage decline in the unit TAM. Our ASPs, however, are trending ahead of expectations and are contributing to our slightly higher revenue expectations for the full year.
Third, we've highlighted the importance of growing the IoT business as we drive and benefit from the rise of billions of smart and connected devices. IOTG revenue was up 11% year-over-year, where we saw strength in our industrial, video and automotive segments.

In our Programmable Solutions Group, revenue declined 7% over the last year after adjusting for acquisition-related accounting charges in the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year decline was due to a weakness in the data center and comms segment, partially offset by growth in industrial and auto and consumer. We also announced an important pilot program with Alibaba cloud, the cloud computing arm of Alibaba Group, for our cloud-based FPGA acceleration service.
We're making good progress against our 4 top priorities for the year and our transformation goals. We're improving the profitability and health of our PC business.",".

While we expect revenue growth to play a role in achieving these targets, hitting this goal will require spending discipline and an intense focus on our strategic priorities.
To sum up the quarter, we're off to a good start and executing well against our priorities. We're delivering a steady cadence of leading products, a powerful segmentation strategy and growing profitability in our client business. We're growing our data center, IoT and memory businesses as customers see data as a competitive advantage and look to Intel as a partner that can help them create, analyze and unlock the value of massive and growing flood of data.",".

                                                   Our first questioner comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.                                         
Vivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [2]
                                                   Brian, I'm curious on the data center growth. The growth rate is now below 6% in Q1. Are you still committed to the high single-digit growth rate for this year? What will drive it? Is it just some pause ahead of the broader launch of the Skylake servers? If you could just give us some more color about why the growth rate is below trend right now and what will help it get back to trend later in the year and over the next few years.

                                                   Sure, Vivek. So the simple answer is, absolutely, we're still committed to the high single-digit growth for the year. If you take a look at it, as Bob and I both mentioned in the call, when you take a look at Q1 comparatives, one, Q1 of last year was 14 weeks. This year, it's a normal 13 weeks. So you add that 1 extra week, that's a couple of percent that you're competing against on a year-over-year basis. Secondly, Q1 tends to be our lowest quarter in general, if you just look at our seasonality, in the year for overall revenue and output and growth in that business, in the data center business.",".

Q: What is the company's outlook for Q2?
A: We're still on track for high single-digit growth in the year."
Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And so as we look out and we see, as you said, the ramp of Skylake in the second half, as we see the normal seasonality, we are absolutely committed to that high single-digit growth rate for the rest of the year.                                         
Vivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [4]
                                                   That's helpful. And as my follow-up, the very rich mix in PCs, ASPs were up very strongly, how sustainable is that? And are you seeing any effect of competition from AMD's product launches?                                         
Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO and Director     [5]
                                                   Sure, I'll start. Bob may want to jump in. Each quarter, we come in here and say we're a little concerned about the sustainability of those high ASPs, and we continue to have that.",".

1. What is the ""very rich mix"" in PCs that Intel is concerned about?
2. How sustainable are the high ASPs for PCs?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So we always forecast, if you take a look at the   what we forecasted for the remainder of the year, we've forecasted a slight decline in ASPs as we move through the year. Now that said, we are continuing to improve our road map. We're continuing to pull in products. And the demand for those high-end, high-performance products from 2 in 1s, gaming, high-end workstations continues to grow faster than we are even able to project. So right now, we've forecasted a slight decline through the rest of the year. And we   but we had strong demand for it in Q1. And I   and we really believe that's a function of our products and our road map.",".

Question: What is Intel's forecasted ASP decline for the remainder of the year?

Answer: Intel Corp is forecasting a slight decline in ASPs through the rest of the year."
Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: From a competition standpoint, we're not seeing anything unusual right now as far as   there's always some level of competition in this market, but   and I'd tell you, for Q1 and our forecast for Q2, we're not seeing anything out of the ordinary from what we normally see.                                         
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CFO and EVP    [6]
                                                   Yes. The only thing I would add, Brian, is the   in the   with the ASPs being a little bit stronger than we expected in the first quarter, as we mentioned, we expect full year revenue to be up $0.5 billion versus where we were 90 days ago. And I would say one of the contributors to that is kind of how we saw ASP trend in the first quarter of the year.

                                                   I guess, first question, in terms your targeted 30% OpEx ratio by 2020, would love to hear what kind of revenue assumptions you're making as part of hitting that.                                         
Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO and Director     [9]
                                                   Sure. So I'll start. First, I thought it would be good to give you a little background, right, why we do we come out and commit this now and kind of what's our thinking behind this. And part of it is we had good progress, brought down spending as a percent of revenue about 1% for 2016.",".

Q: What was the main driver of that spending reduction? 
A: So, we had a number of things. We had a good product cycle, we had good execution, we had good cost discipline. And then we had some headwinds from currency, geopolitical events, and then we had some other things as well. But the main driver was really good execution and cost discipline."
Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We're a quarter in, and we're seeing good progress in our efforts along 2017 of taking it down another   slightly more than 1% as we look at this year. And so we just really took a look at do we think we can maintain that progress and continue to drive efficiencies while driving growth. The growth we've expected is what we talked about in the analyst meeting back in February, which is that mid-single-digit type of growth for the overall company. And that's kind of where we're at from a growth perspective. And then the cost reduction and the efficiencies are driving the rest of it.

What is the mid-single-digit type of growth that Intel expects for the overall company?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And I would just say that the   we kind of   our focus is on growing the earnings performance for the company in the short, medium and long term. And what we laid out at Analyst Day, as Brian indicated, was, over the next 3 years, low single-digit growth, operating income growing faster than revenue and EPS growing faster than operating income. And that's the   against that, we're trying to obviously make revenue grow faster, continue to manage the efficiency in which we operate the company and drive strong earnings growth performance over the short, medium and long term. So the 30% target is consistent with kind of the 3-year plan, and we know that there's opportunities for us to be more efficient as we go forward.",".

I guess, as my follow-up, was hoping to take a look at memory and here, would love to hear from you as to how we should think about layering in depreciation from Dalian this year, next and when you would expect to turn a profit on the operating margin line.

Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: In terms of profitability, for this year, when we talked to you at Analyst Day, Rob kind of laid out a plan where the Core 3D NAND would be profitable in the second half of the year, but our losses for the business would still be roughly in line with where we were in 2016. And that was a function of really 3 things: good performance on 3D NAND, continuing to ramp Dalian and continuing to invest in our Optane product or 3D XPoint. So those dynamics have us breaking even for the core business in the second half of the year, and we said that near the end of 2018, as a whole, the memory business would be profitable.",".

Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So I'm not exactly sure I completely understood your slight growth. What we said is we're   for DCG as a business, we're in the high single-digits growth rate. So we're absolutely committing to that. We talked about the 6% in Q1 and how, as we go through the year, we'll continue to grow. From the standpoint we've been sampling Skylake to the cloud guys now for some period of time, in fact, backed into latter half of last year, but you really don't see the ramp of Skylake in volume at any of the customers, whether it be the cloud guys or the rest of the enterprise and networking and all until the second half. That's really when the volume kicks in on the server side. And that's absolutely what we had forecasted, and there's no change in that forecast whatsoever.",".

But for us, on our modem, it continues to gain momentum. We've talked about our one large customer, but we continue to get other interest in it.

Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And really, looking out over time, we have the next several series of modems over the next few years from an LTE perspective, and then we're already working on and believe we're leading, if you looked at our output from MWC back in February as well, on the 5G side, which is both at the modem and back through the base station. And that, we believe, is really the differential that we're able to provide in the communication space, is in a space like 5G where the modem and the base station and backhaul is so integrated and so important, we're able to provide that end-to-end solution. From a foundry perspective, we continue to talk to several large customers, and as we're able to, we'll talk about volumes and launching of new products.",".

                                                   Yes. And the only thing that I would add is the strong CCG revenue growth of 6% in the quarter. As you'll remember, because our first launch client really didn't ramp until the second half of last year, the first half revenue growth for CCG will   particularly because of modem, will have a relatively easy comp. So that's a contributor to growth in the first half. And as Brian said, we   the comps get much tougher in the second half because our one client launched in the second half last year. But given the products we have, we feel relatively good about where we are.

                                                   First, I wanted to ask again about this 30% spending target. You guys just had an Analyst Day like 2 months ago. It seems like something that probably should have been talked about then. So what's changed in the last 2 months that means you need to roll the target out on today's call? And how should I try to reconcile that target with some of your other commentary at the Analyst Day where you were fairly gung ho about the need to invest to fund growth?                                         
Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO and Director     [21]
                                                   So I'll start, Stacy. I think you have to take a look at where we're at. You're kind of asking a couple of questions.",". 

What is the company's spending target for this year?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So first, from the growth standpoint, our position about investing and continuing to really drive growth is absolutely still just as strong as it was back in February at the Analyst Day. And I'd tell you, Q1 is a great example of that with year-over-year growth, another record quarter coming off a record year. And raising the year and forecasting another record year. So I feel very good about the investments we've made, both short term, medium term and long term, to drive that growth. That said, Bob and I have both been looking at now how do we do that and also at the same time, become more and more efficient.","

Question: How do you think you can become more efficient?

Answer: We're looking at ways to be more efficient in terms of how we operate our business, both in terms of the way we sell and the way we operate our factories."
Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And what we've looked at now is that our performance and becoming more efficient in 2016 and taking about 1% out of our spending as a percent of revenue was very successful. We understand how we did that. As we looked at our first quarter performance and what we believe we can take out for the rest of 2017 is another percent of spending as a percent of revenue, slightly more actually. And then I think one of the things that Bob's really brought in as the CFO is new ways of thinking and new looks at how to continue that trend. And so taking 1% a year or so out of our spending as a percent of revenue is something we think we can go and accomplish while driving that growth.",".

Question: What is Intel's goal for reducing spending as a percent of revenue?

Answer: Intel's goal is to reduce spending as a percent of revenue by 1% each year."
Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And that is the effort that we've spent over the last couple months really digging into those details. And that's why we felt like it was important we came out now and really said, yes, we are committing to that. We understand the details behind it. And we've got a history now that tells us we can say it with confidence.                                         
Stacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [22]
                                                   Got it. For my follow-up, I'd like to ask about DCG margins. So they were 35% this quarter. It doesn't sound like there was anything structural like the warranty charge that hit last quarter. This sounds like the drivers around allocation and everything else we've discussed. But it's still quite a bit lower than I think most would have expected.",".

What was the main driver of lower margins?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: How should we think about that margin profile trending through the year as the Skylake parts ramp?

Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CFO and EVP    [23]
                                                   Yes, I would   Stacy, we kind of provided a long-term outlook of 40% to 45% operating margin for DCG. Our expectations for this year were for growth, as Brian indicated earlier, high single digits and at the lower end of that range, of the 40% to 45%. In the first quarter, just to be clear, the 9-point drop in margin, 7 points of that is attributed to the fact that DCG is a bigger business, and we've indicated it will be first on 7-nanometer and a fast follow on 10-nanometer.",".

Question: How should we think about that margin profile trending through the year as the Skylake parts ramp? 
Answer: We expect margin to trend up as we ramp up production of our Skylake processors."
Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: As a result, it gets a bigger share of our technology development and our SG&A allocation. So 7 points of the 9 decline are simply a result of how we allocate costs to the business segments. I think in terms of going through the course of the year, the things that are going to change, as Brian indicated, we got strong product offering coming out in the second half of the year. We expect ASPs to improve as we go throughout the year. As you know, the first quarter is always the lower end of margin seasonality   from a seasonal perspective. And we expect product costs to improve as we continue the transition from 22- to 14-nanometer. So it's in line with our long-term expectations, no change; our outlook for 2017, no change.",".

Question: What is your outlook for 2017?

Answer: We expect 2017 to be another strong year for Intel."
Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: The biggest fundamental driver to margin performance is simply the success of the data center business in terms of growing, in terms of being a bigger chunk of the overall business, in terms of being a beneficiary of leading-edge technology that bears 7 points impact because of the higher burden of our allocations on the business. So we feel good on where we are for the quarter and where we're positioned for the full year.

                                                   But those allocation charges aren't going to go away anytime soon. It sounds like they're going to hang around for a while if you're talking about 10 and the 7-nanometer.

The 7 points in March, does that represent a peak? Or do we run into a situation where as absolute costs for 7 and 10 go up throughout the year, you could see op margins in DCG continue to be down just because the percent doesn't change but the dollars are going up?

Question: What is the company's outlook for 2017 and how does that impact the allocation charges in March?
Answer: Intel Corp. expects 2017 to be another strong year with growth across all its businesses. As a result, the company expects its overall costs to increase, but expects its operating margins in its Data Center Group (DCG) to remain relatively stable."
Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Swan,  Intel Corporation - CFO and EVP    [28]
                                                   Yes. I mean, our expectation is the operating margins for DCG will improve by quarter throughout the year. Again, it'll be a function of the normal seasonality of the profitability of the business. It will still bear a significant chunk of our tech development and SG&A costs. But you may remember that our development costs during the course of the year, as we indicated, I think maybe last couple quarters, that comes down from first half to second half. So as that cost comes down, all of our businesses will benefit from lower costs.",".

Question: What is the development cost?
Answer: The development cost is the cost of developing new products and services."
Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And then the third thing, higher   yes, the real fundamentals of the business are higher ASPs with good product with an outstanding performance and getting better and better yields on our 14-nanometer product going through the fab will be benefits to the profitability of the business. The lowest point Q1 expectations, it'll grow each quarter throughout the year, and we would expect full year operating margins, despite higher absorption, higher burden from our indirect costs, at roughly 40% for the year.

So in a place like this where we think we have differential technology like 3D NAND and our Optane/3D XPoint, I'm going to look for ways to invest that have a positive NPV.

                                                   Sure. So we don't break out revenue on specific products like Phi, but Xeon Phi does continue to ramp and grow from a product standpoint. We have some additional products that we'll launch in the second half of this year around Xeon Phi from Knights Mill.",".

Question: What other key customers are adopting Xeon Phi?
Answer: We have some additional products that we'll launch in the second half of this year around Xeon Phi from Knights Mill."
Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And from an FPGA or other accelerators, we continue to get several of the large cloud providers, networking providers who are continuing to use our FPGAs. But again, we don't break out on a   by customer standpoint. But we still are committed to our 6% roughly growth on the PSG business this year. Q1 was down just because of some unique   there was some extra buying in the latter half of last year around some cloud. And the networking guys are typically down in the first quarter. So it hit its forecast, but it's down year-over-year. We think we'll recover that as we go through the rest of the year from an FPGA.",".

Question: What is the company's forecast for growth in the PSG business this year?

Answer: Intel Corp expects its PSG business to grow by 6% this year."
Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And then as we go out through the second half of this year, the first of the products comes out in silicon from our Nirvana acquisition, which is another form of AI acceleration. We'll get that first silicon. We'll start to work with customers, and you'll see that come in 2018 as an additional accelerator adding to our full AI portfolio.

                                                   Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri from Cowen and Company.                                         
Timothy Michael Arcuri,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst    [35]
                                                   I just wanted to clarify your answer to John's question. So in terms of the $300 million year-over-year burden on DCG operating margin that's due to the cost allocation, is that sort of a fixed number going forward? Or does that absolute number get better through the year?                                         
Robert H.",".

Robert H. So in terms of the $300 million year-over-year burden on DCG operating margin that's due to the cost allocation, is that sort of a fixed number going forward?"

                                                   The   there's 2 dynamics on our total pool of indirect costs that are going on for the company. One is our SG&A indirect costs are coming down. Brian referred to that earlier about the progress we made on direct spending overall coming down another 1 point plus during the course of the year. And second, our R&D costs, particularly as it relates to Moore's Law for 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, goes up a little bit. So during the course of the year, our overall costs will be roughly flat that we'll be allocating to the businesses.",".

What is Intel's total pool of indirect costs?

Intel's total pool of indirect costs is coming down."
Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And DCG will get a larger portion of that than it has historically, roughly impacting the business by 7 points because of its bigger size and because of the decision to have it be a beneficiary of Moore's Law sooner than it has historically.                                         
Timothy Michael Arcuri,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Analyst    [37]
                                                   And then as a follow-up, I   so I just wanted to clarify. So the NSG, so you're expecting to still lose money into the first half of next year. And is that what you're saying? Or are you saying that for the entirety of the year next year you'll be profitable?                                         
Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO and Director     [38]
                                                   So separate out again and remember we're making the large investments in Dalian.",.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So from a pure 3D NAND perspective, we said it goes breakeven and beyond in the latter half of this year. So for next year, our standard NAND business will be profitable. 3D XPoint plus the Optane product is additional investments we're making. We said that that's in the second half of next year it goes to breakeven. And the overall business does as well. We haven't gotten any more granular than that for right now.

Ross Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [40]
                                                   Wanted to ask the first one on the OpEx side of things, and I applaud the 30% target. It's good to see that commitment. But I wanted to focus a little bit more in the near term.",". What is the 30% OpEx target for the second half of this year? And then what is the target for next year?

Intel Corp said that it expects its standard NAND business to be profitable in the second half of 2017, and that its 3D XPoint plus Optane product will be profitable in the second half of next year."
Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: In the first quarter, it was about $100 million above what you had guided. In the second quarter, it's a bit above what I expected, too, especially given McAfee. So could you give us a little color on why it was a little bit higher in the first quarter and where we are in the restructuring benefits and the McAfee benefits? If you can do anything to size either of those in the near term, that will be helpful.                                         
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CFO and EVP    [41]
                                                   Yes. I think first quarter, a little bit over, I'd characterize it primarily in the round. I think for first half, we're basically implying $10.6 billion of OpEx, and we're committed to our $20.5 billion for the first   sorry, for the full year.",".

Question: What was the primary driver of the $100 million over guidance in the first quarter? 
Answer: The primary driver was primarily round activity."
Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So $10.6 billion in first half drops to $9.9 billion in the second half, and there's really 2 primary drivers to that. One is, as you alluded, the exit of McAfee will be roughly $300 million out from the first half run rate. And then secondly, just the completion of our previously announced restructuring programs will continue to bear fruit on lower OpEx in the second half of the year. So first half, $10.6 billion; second half, $9.9 billion; McAfee exit, continued execution and feel good about full year of $20.5 billion.                                         
Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO and Director     [42]
                                                   And just a reminder, that $20.5 billion takes another roughly 1%, slightly more, out of our spending as a percent of revenue. So that's all baked in.",".

Question: What is the primary driver of the $9.9 billion decrease in revenue in the second half of the year?
Answer: The primary driver of the $9.9 billion decrease in revenue in the second half of the year is the exit of McAfee, which will be roughly $300 million out from the first half run rate."

                                                   I guess my follow-up then switches to the gross margin side of things. It's staying solid, and I might be at the risk of a rounding error in this question as well. But considering that you raised your revenues and ASPs were a big portion of that, usually that's a pretty good follow-through. So the fact that you're keeping the gross margin guide for the year flat at 63%, are there any incremental offsets to the goodness that the revenue and the ASPs would generate? Or is it in fact just rounding?                                         
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CFO and EVP    [44]
                                                   I don't know if it's rounding or not.",".

Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: I'd say $0.5 billion of revenue upside at kind of roughly gross margin dynamics of the business will fall through an additional $0.05 of EPS. So we feel great about that. I think the dynamics of more the business is in the second half. ASPs will improve for data center. As Brian alluded earlier, we've assumed that ASPs will decline a little for the client business and the fast growth of memory and modem will have a negative mix impact on gross margin. So I think when we take that all together through the year, we felt a fairly consistent 63% with all those puts and takes throughout through the course of the year. And Q1 was where we expected; Q2, consistent with Q1 and full year.

                                                   And our final question comes from Kevin Cassidy from Stifel.                                         
Kevin E.",".

What is the company's outlook for the rest of the year?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Cassidy,  Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director     [46]
                                                   Just on the capacity that you're building in Dalian, can you say what percentage increase you're getting? Or is it directly correlated to the revenue growth that you're seeing in the memory group?                                         
Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO and Director     [47]
                                                   Percentage. So a, yes, the growth in the memory business that goes through the rest of this year is largely driven by the ramp of the Dalian factory along with some assumptions around strong ASPs as demand continues to outpace supply the market in general. And so if you take a look from here on, in fact, 2017 by then, as we go out into 2018 and beyond, Dalian will continue to be the driver of growth of that business.                                         
Kevin E.",".

What is the Dalian factory responsible for?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Cassidy,  Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director     [48]
                                                   I guess another way to phrase the question is what's the bit growth? Most other memory companies give a projection of what their bit growth is.                                         
Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO and Director     [49]
                                                   Yes. I don't think we've actually ever given a bit growth. So that's not a public number. We can take a look at that for next quarter as to whether we want to start adding that to our normal distribution. But what we've always talked about is growth of the business from a profit or revenue standpoint and overall growth, partly because, remember, more and more of that business will become things like 3D XPoint/Optane, and bits will be a little bit different there, right? Not all bits are going to be created equal.",".

What is the bit growth for Intel Corp?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: That's a very differentiating technology. It's really got performance of DRAM-like devices with NAND non-volatility and pricing in between. And so those bits are a bit different than, say, typical NAND bits, and I wouldn't want to just lump those all into a standard number. So we need to think about how we'd really go and present this to you if you want to think about it from a bit standpoint. And that   it's around 5% of the business this year, but as you go out into next year and beyond, it becomes a larger and larger percentage as we see more and more products, especially in the data centers, use the Optane technology.                                         
Kevin E. Cassidy,  Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director     [50]
                                                   Right. And maybe if I could ask that question, too, of Optane.",".

What is the Optane technology?

The Optane technology is a type of storage that is used in data centers. It is similar to DRAM, but it has non-volatility and is cheaper than regular NAND."

                                                   Thanks, Mark. I'd like to cover three things with you today before handing off to Bob: a brief review of our results for the year, an update on the transformation of the Company, and a look ahead at 2017 and Intel's future. 
First, the review of our results. Q4 was a strong finish to a record year in which we increased revenue 7% and net income 9%. The Client Computing Group, Data Center Group, Internet of Things, and Intel Security all grew in 2016, with DCG and IoTG setting full-year revenue and volume records. 
The acquisition of Altera added 3 percentage points to our overall growth rate.",".

What was the Altera acquisition's contribution to Intel's overall growth rate? 3 percentage points."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: In the Data Center, cloud service provider revenue grew 24%, while enterprise revenue was down 3% for the full year. Additionally, we are very excited that Com Service Provider revenue grew 19%. And across all of our customer categories, adjacency revenue grew an incredible 21%, with strength in ethernet controllers, Omni-Path fabric controllers and switches, and network ASICs. 
IoT revenue was up 15% for the full year, driven by strength in the video, retail, and industrial segment. In Q4, we launched new Apollo Lake and Kaby Lake product, and we won key designs in automotive and video. 
Our Memory business finished the year with record quarterly revenue, while full-year revenue was down 1%. This was an investment year for the memory business, but NSG operating margins improved meaningfully in the fourth quarter.",".

What was the Com Service Provider revenue growth rate for the full year?
19%"
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We're now shipping 3D NAND from our Fab68, and we just qualified our first 3D cross point-based Optane SSD, which we expect to ship for revenue in the first quarter. And our 3D cross point memory DIMMs are sampled to Data Center customers. 
The Client Computing business achieved impressive results, driven by strong execution and higher ASPs, as customers bought a richer mix of Intel Core product. This was also a breakout year for CCG's wireless communications product line. Our 7360 LTE modem ramped into high volume and we shipped record Wi-Fi units. 
I'm very proud of the Client Computing business, and what this team has delivered in 2016. Our strategy of delivering consistent product leadership, segmentation, and differentiation paid off. We achieved record i7 units, and overall core mix in 2016.",".

1. What is the Client Computing business?
2. What are the results for this business in 2016?
3. What strategy did Intel use to achieve these results?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And Client Computing revenue was up 2% for the year, despite the declining PC market. 
The Programmable Solutions Group was up about 7% on a non-GAAP basis over Altera's 2015 results. PSG saw strength across many segments, with particular strength in compute and storage. The Programmable Solutions business sampled the industry's first, and only, 14-nanometer FPGAs this year, known as Stratix 10. This product line has the largest demand pipeline in Altera's history. The integration of Altera into Intel was an important milestone in what was a transformative year for Intel. This team did a great job of meeting integration objectives, while continuing to deliver new products and grow the business.",".

Question: What was the main driver of growth in PSG?
Answer: The Programmable Solutions Group saw strength across many segments, with particular strength in compute and storage."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
In 2016, we took other important, and in some cases difficult, steps to position  the Company for future success, improve the alignment of our resources to our strategy, and accelerate our transformation to the company that powers the cloud and billions of smart and connected devices. Our restructuring initiative focused on our investments on the product and technologies that will fuel our growth. And that work, combined with improvements in 14-nanometer costs, drove a 30% operating margin improvement in our Client business. 
Our decision to establish McAfee as a separate, independent company was another transformative move. This transaction will give McAfee the flexibility to invest independently, tighten our focus, and allow Intel to share in McAfee's future success as the market demand for world-class security product continues to grow.",".

What was the 30% operating margin improvement in Client business?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
And finally, looking ahead to 2017 at Intel's future, I am confident we are making the right investments to compete and win, not only in the segments where Intel is strong today, but also in new areas that are poised for growth driven by the emerging flood of data. By 2020, the average person will generate about 1.5 gigabytes of data per day, while smart and connected devices of the future will produce data at many times that rate. 
Autonomous cars, for example, will generate about 4,000 gigabytes of data each day. The resulting explosion of data is creating tremendous opportunity. But data alone isn't valuable. It is the transmission, aggregation, and analysis of the data that results in value and impact.",":

What is the average person's data output expected to be in 2020?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Intel will play a central role in those steps because our products are key to turning raw data into high-value insight and information. Our investments in advanced research and development are making this all possible, while significantly expanding our TAM at the same time. 
These investments are creating opportunities in segments from autonomous driving, where we are uniquely positioned to be the compute engine in the vehicle and the data center; to 5G where we are building on our momentum in 4G to establish leadership; to artificial intelligence, where we are providing the industry's most complete range of products to accelerate all AI solutions, from the edge to the data center. We are already seeing signs of progress. In autonomous driving, we are winning key designs like BMW, Delphi, and Baidu.",".

What is the ""TAM"" (total addressable market) for Intel?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: In 5G, we are leading in the definition of standards, prototyping, and field trial. 
Our Network business saw strong growth as infrastructure moved to Intel architecture in anticipation of 5G. Our design wins and network virtualization innovation position us for leadership share in the wireless access market. Other proof points of our progress include important partnerships with AT&T, SK Telecom, Korea Telecom, and Verizon, and the announcement earlier this month of the industry's first global 5G modem. 
Finally, in artificial intelligence, we believe we have the industry's strongest product portfolio. Intel processors power well over 90% of servers deployed to support machine-learning workload, and we are winning the vast majority of AI solution, based on strong product performance and customer value. 
Wrapping things up, I am very pleased with Intel's performance in 2016.",".

                                                   Thanks, Brian. The fourth quarter was an outstanding quarter. Revenue was up 10%, operating income was up 11%, and EPS was up 4% year over year. Revenue set an all-time record at $16.4 billion, and operating income was $4.9 billion. Fourth-quarter operating margin was 30%, flat year over year. Gross margin, at 63%, was down 2 points, primarily driven by a couple of one-time events related to product warranty cost, and long-term IP agreements.",. Question: What was the main driver of revenue growth in the fourth quarter? Answer: The main driver of revenue growth in the fourth quarter was product demand. We saw strong demand for our products in both the consumer and commercial segments. We also saw good demand for our data center products. Question: What was the main driver of operating income growth in the fourth quarter? Answer: The main driver of operating income growth in the fourth quarter was product demand. We saw strong demand for our products in both the consumer and commercial segments. We also saw good demand for our data center products.

Earnings per share of $0.79 was up $0.03 from a year ago. The Client Computing Group had revenue of $9.1 billion, up 4% year over year. 
During the fourth quarter, the worldwide PC supply chain remained healthy, and we saw some inventory burn during the quarter. Client ASPs were up 7% year over year, and core mix was at an all-time high as a result of the success of our segmentation strategies, and strength in gaming and high-end systems. This segment had another quarter of significant profit growth, with operating profit growing 30% from a year ago, as the business continues to benefit from lower spending, richer product mix, and continued improvements in 14-nanometer unit costs.",".

Question: What was the Client Computing Group's revenue?
Answer: Client Computing Group's revenue was $9.1 billion."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
The Data Center Group had record revenue of $4.7 billion, up 8% year over year. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see robust growth in the cloud and com service provider segments of the business, which both grew approximately 30% year over year, partially offset by a 7% decline in the enterprise and government segment over the same horizon. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.9 billion, down 14% year over year. Operating margin was impacted by the two one-time items I referred to earlier, and the ramp of 14 nanometer on our server products, which we expect to generate continued cost improvements over time. 
Our Internet of Things business achieved record revenue of $726 million, growing 16% year over year, driven by strength in both retail and industrial segment.",".

What was the main reason for the 14% decline in operating profit?
The main reason for the 14% decline in operating profit was the two one-time items I referred to earlier."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Operating profit for the business was $182 million, up 37% year over year. 
Our Memory business had a record revenue of $816 million, up 25% year over year, with strong demand for Data Center SSD solutions, with demand signals outpacing supply. We have made great progress ramping Fab68, with yields and unit costs well ahead of expectation. This segment had an operating loss of $91 million, largely driven by cost associated with 3D cross point, and start-up costs for our memory capacity. 
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $420 million, and operating profit was $80 million. Our Intel Security Group business had revenue of $550 million, and operating profit of $103 million. 
Turning to the full-year 2016, revenue grew 7%, operating margin grew 11%, and EPS grew 9%.",".

What was the main driver of growth in the Memory business?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Operating margin percent improved by 1 point, while gross margin was approximately 63%, flat to 2015. Spending was $21 billion, or 35.4% of revenue, down 1 point from 2015, primarily from the restructuring programs we began earlier in the year. Operating profit for the year was $16.5 billion. Earnings per share for the year was $2.72, up $0.23 from the prior year. 
In 2016, the business generated record cash from operations of $21.8 billion. We purchased $9.6 billion in capital assets, paid $4.9 billion in dividends, and repurchased about $2.6 billion of stock. Total cash balance was $17.1 billion, down $8.2 billion. Total debt was $25.3 billion. Our net cash balance, total cash less debt and inclusive of our other longer-term investments, is approximately negative  $2.3 billion. 
Now let me turn to guidance. First, some context.",".

What was the company's operating margin percent in 2016?

The company's operating margin percent was 1 point, which improved from 2015."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: First, our guidance assumes a stable macroeconomic environment, but we have taken a more cautious view of PC consumption versus third parties, particularly in our outlook for the emerging markets including Russia, China, and Latin America. Second, for the Data Center, we continue to expect similar growth rates in the cloud and com segment, but we are not expecting an improvement in enterprise. This gets us to an expectation of high-single-digit growth in the Data Center business. 
Third, as a reminder, we have one less week as a result of the inclusion of an extra work week in 2016. And last, we have assumed the Intel Security transaction will close in Q2, and our full-year guidance reflects one full quarter of the Group's consolidated results.",".

Question: What is the guidance for the Data Center business?
Answer: The guidance assumes high-single-digit growth in the Data Center business."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We have lots of work to do to close this out, and in the event the close happens at the end of the second quarter, we would update our full-year guidance by approximately an additional $500 million of revenue, and $100 million of operating income. 
As we look forward to the first quarter of 2017, we are forecasting a midpoint of the revenue range at $14.8 billion, up 7% year over year, and down from the fourth quarter. This is at the lower end of our seasonal range and reflects an expectation of lower Core brand mix, and ASP coming off a strong holiday-selling period for gaming and other premium PC systems.",".

Question: What is your outlook for the first quarter of 2017?
Answer: We are forecasting a midpoint of the revenue range at $14.8 billion, up 7% year over year, and down from the fourth quarter."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
For the first quarter, we expect operating margin percent to increase 4 points, year over year, gross margins to be flat at approximately 63%, and spending to be $5.3 billion, down 1%. We expect EPS to be approximately $0.65, up 20% year over year. 
Turning to the full-year 2017, we are expecting revenue to be roughly flat. Revenue is expected to grow in the low-single digits, after excluding the Intel Security Group from both years. We expect operating margin percent to be up 1 point year over year, with flat gross margins, and direct spending as a percent of revenue, down 1 point versus 2016. 
Let me provide a bit more detail on our year-over-year direct spending. Our restructuring plans are on track, including reducing our headcount by approximately 15,000 heads and generating gross savings of $1.6 billion.",".

Question: What is the expected increase in operating margin percent?
Answer: The expected increase in operating margin percent is 1 point."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We are reallocating investments from CCG to higher growth segments, and are continuing to invest in areas that extend our leadership position in Moore's Law, and expand TAM opportunities, such as memory and autonomous driving. We anticipate the net benefit of these actions to result in an additional point of improvement in direct spending as a percent of revenue, in 2017. 
We expect EPS of approximately $2.80, up 3% year over year. In 2016, we had a fairly significant gain from our ICAP Portfolio. Our 2017 guidance assumes that we'll have gains roughly in line with 2016 levels. The capital spending forecast for 2017 is $12 billion, up $2.5 billion from 2016, as we continue to ramp our memory capacity. 
In closing, 2016 started out slow but finished strong.",".

What is the net benefit of these actions?
The net benefit of these actions is expected to result in an additional point of improvement in direct spending as a percent of revenue, in 2017."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Our CCG business is focused and executing extremely well in a declining market, and provides the scale that is required to advance Moore's Law, generates significant cash flows, and enables investments for growth. 
Our growth-oriented businesses were up 15% collectively, as we continue to transform the Company from PC-centric company to a company of smart and connected devices that power the cloud.

                                                   Hey, thanks, guys. Just digging out on the segments. The CCG operating margins were, I think, the highest in the last few years. DCG was kind of the lowest in the last few years. Can you talk about the trend in operating margins for those two segments, for this year, given the guidance?                                          
Bob Swan,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [3]
                                                   Yes, Chris, the CCG performance   a couple dynamics that are driving the kind of record margins. One, higher ASPs on the strong mix that Brian referred to.",.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Secondly, real strong unit cost. It has been on 14nm for a while, so we expect that to continue. 
And then, constrained investments in the CCG business as we focus more on investing heavier in the higher growth businesses. Real good performance, and those are the dynamics we are expecting in 2017. 
On the DCG front, good in Q4 and then project forward. Nice ASP performance in the quarter, as we migrate from Haswell to Broadwell, and as we think about Skylake in 2017, we expect that to continue. Unit costs in DCG is a little bit higher, because we are coming off great unit cost performance on 22nm, but as we migrate to 14nm. In the earlier stages of that cycle, unit costs are a little bit higher.",".

Question: What is the expected unit cost for 14nm products?
Answer: We expect that the unit cost for 14nm products will continue to be strong."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And then we are increasing our investments in DCG on a year-over-year basis. So, dynamics are relatively good. 
The one, I referred to it a little earlier, but in terms of Q4, we had a couple one-time items that really weighed on the profitability or operating margins of DCG that we think are well-bounded, and do not expect to continue into 2017. And just quickly, one we entered in a long-term cross-license agreement and patent-purchase agreement particularly in the com space in the quarter. And DCG was impacted by a portion of that cost in the quarter. 
But secondly, and a little more significant, we were observing a product quality issue in the fourth quarter. We had slightly higher expected failure rates under certain use and time constraints, and we established a reserve to deal with that.",".

Question: What was the product quality issue?
Answer: The product quality issue was a higher expected failure rates under certain use and time constraints."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We think we have it relatively well-bounded with a minor design fix that we are working with our client to resolve. 
So those two, one-timers in the fourth quarter weighed on DCG margins, and we do not expect that to continue in 2017.

What is driving PC unit growth?

The strength in the PC market is due to a number of factors, including increased demand for gaming and productivity software, as well as increased demand for laptops. We believe this market is sustainable, and we expect PC unit growth to continue in 2017."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
If you take a look  Bob mentioned in his portion of the talk, of, hey, we have taken a slightly more conservative view of 2017 than third parties for what we see the overall PC unit market as. And we had extremely strong, I mean, record Core i7s, just record Core mix in the fourth quarter, that as we look at Q1 and we look at 2017, we've factored a little bit of caution into that as well. 
Those two things put us in the PC market at a unit level in the mid-single-digit decline. That is better if you went back a year ago we were in the high single-digit. Depending on how you looked at it, and where you counted some the 2-in-1 devices.",".

What is Intel's view of the overall PC market?
Intel's view is that the overall PC market is in a mid-single-digit decline."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
So it is starting to get better, but I don't think we are back at a zero unit or positive unit. But as Bob said, what we have been really focusing on in that space is how do you make money?

As we said, we took a look at the 2017 view on Enterprise to be relatively equivalent to what we saw in 2016. Which says that Enterprise continues to decline. I think that is certainly some of that is that it's moving to a public cloud, it's moving to those areas at a faster rate than, I think, we expected.",".

Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
It also has been a little bit slow about developing private clouds, and we are working with several partners like Microsoft Azure and others, around the private cloud segments, as well, for the Enterprise. But if you take a look at the long-term, we still see this as the growth engine and still getting into that double-digit regime. 
Remember, for us, Enterprise is now less than 50% of our overall Data Center business. And areas that are growing even faster, or as fast as cloud in most cases, are the networking and storage space, which we have very low market share in still, and it is a great opportunity for us. And in the emerging areas like Silicon Photonics, Omni-Path fabric, Rack Scale Design and 3D Xpoint.",":

So, for us,  our view is, this is a   anytime you're going through a market transition, you're not going to get the cloud-to-Enterprise mix perfect. And this is an anomaly right now, that we've forecasted, we think, accurately and adjusted for it the way it is. But our long-term growth was actually based on other factors, and we are still very confident in those growth areas. I don't know if Bob wants to add

                                                   Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess the first one on OpEx, and it's more of a conceptual one for you, Brian. On flat revenues it is great to see some OpEx leverage on there, but I think some people are hoping for a little bit more as you had the restructuring only halfway done, and then the McAfee sale that's pending. So, can you talk conceptually about how you balance the desire to reinvest versus the desire to get the profitability up to your long-term targets?                                          
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [21]

We always said there would be some mix between taking that to the bottom line, and reinvesting it in those growth areas. And so, as we have done acquisitions like Nervana, for artificial intelligence, we want to invest in those businesses now, bring them onto our silicon, integrate them into our software stack.

It is around Data and Data Centers, again.

                                                   The only thing I would add, is just to maybe make it a little simple for people, as we look at our full-year guidance that we gave, and then we extract out three-quarters of McAfee.

On direct spending itself, we will be down roughly   our guidance implies we'll be down roughly $0.5 billion year-on-year.

                                                   Sure. I would tell you that we always look at this environment and say, there is going to be a competitive risk in the environment.

And then, we showed at CES, the first working 10nm Cannonlake product, which we are still planning to ship by the end of this year, and really ramp into 2018. We still believe that our roadmap and our leadership will continue to give us the performance the customers want and desire. And so, that did not necessarily factor into that more cautious forecast.

                                                   Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a question, first, on the guidance for next year. Unless I am doing the math wrong, to get to $2.80 I need a fairly sizable reduction in share count. So, is that true? Could you tell us how you're thinking about shares for next year? Are you intending to use the cash from McAfee to buy back shares to get to that number?                                          
Bob Swan,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [28]
                                                   First, in essence, the guidance year-on-year doesn't really anticipate any dramatic change in our share count. I think philosophically, our approach is to offset dilution from our comp-base programs, so all else equal, share count relatively flat year-on-year.",".

Question: What is Intel's philosophy on share count?
Answer: Intel's philosophy is to offset dilution from its comp-base programs."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
I think, the one thing worth noting is   in our ICAP Portfolio in 2016, we had a fairly significant gain, and what I indicated in the prepared remarks is we expect, roughly in 2017, that gain to be inline with what 2016 generated. 
I think in terms of implied share count in our guidance, it is essentially flat year on year.                                          
Stacy Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [29]

But if I throw the McAfee cost back in, you've actually got OpEx going up fairly sizably year-over-year, and your employee count is actually up year-over-year, even though you supposedly had a pretty big layoff.",".

Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
So I guess, can you talk little bit more specifically about exactly what the additional spending is going on? Is it people, versus technology, versus something else? Where is it going? And do you view those investments as looking to open up new markets versus being defensive in nature? Or maybe a mix of both?                                          
Bob Swan,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [30]
                                                   Yes, in terms of the type of cost, maybe two-fold. Yes, people and yes, technology/Moore's law, at the macro level and that expresses itself in higher depreciation year-on-year. In our guide, our depreciation is up quite a bit, and a portion that will flow through direct spending.",".

Question: Can you give us a breakdown of the direct spending? 
Answer: We're seeing a mix of both, depending on the product. For example, we've seen a lot of investments in data center infrastructure, as well as new products like our Intel Core i9 processor and X-series graphics."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
Again, on a more macro basis, at the risk of maybe repeating myself, we are investing more in DCG, and in particular, bringing some of these adjacent products that Brian referred to, to market. We continue to invest in memory, and particularly in the 3D Xpoint product, and we continue to invest in IoT. So those three businesses are getting a disproportionate share of the investment, because those are the businesses that we have seen really strong growth in 2016, and we are counting on continued growth in 2017. 
The second area, and again, we talked about this a little bit, but we see real opportunities in autonomous driving that play to our strengths and our capabilities.",".

Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And we will   we are making step function increase in our investments to position ourselves very well for that industry, and that market, as it evolves. 
And then again, third, 7nm, a technology investment, and the spend associated with building a new pilot line in 2017, is also an additional investment. 
So we are executing on our restructuring programs. It was   we took out roughly   we made the tough decisions in 2016 that resulted in roughly 11,000 fewer people as a result of our restructuring program. We are not quite done, but I would say we are on track. At the same time we are making investments both in technology and people, to strengthen and enhance our competitive position in the areas that we see as real opportunities for us.",".

                                                   The only thing I would add, Stacy, as more of a blunt answer to your question, is if you take a look at the areas that we are talking about, in almost every case, these are new and expanding TAMs for us. So, even look at the places where we're going in the Data Center, and this is my point earlier about Enterprise versus cloud. 
Enterprise is now less than 50% of our total makeup for the Data Center group. And the cloud is growing great, and that will continue, but if you look at the areas   the majority of the rest of the growth for the rest of this decade, in the Data Center alone, it's networking and storage where we have very low market share today.",".

What is Intel's strategy for increasing its market share in networking and storage?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: But we are bringing things like software defined networking, and NFV to those. And so that is growing and expanding TAM, as those markets move to Intel architecture. 
And then it is, going into Rack Scale Design, Omni-Path fabric, Silicon Photonic, those are all, again, new either nascent or expanding TAMs for us. Autonomous cars and the IoT space are new and expanding TAMs for us. 5G is a TAM that is brand-new that will be really being built out over the rest of this decade. 
And then memory   if you look at the large part of the investment we are making, it's 3D Xpoint, which really rearchitects memory and storage, and will create a new market in our mind. And we believe we are unique in having that technology.",".

What are some of the new or expanding TAMs for Intel Corp?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
So to me, when I look at the investment, they are all focused around data, they're all in support of how the Data Center ecosystem works, and they are all in either expanding or new TAMs for Intel. And so that is why I see the growth in those areas. It is not just enhancing the technologies that we already have. We will do that, but the new investments are really focused on the new areas.

                                                   Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. 
Brian, my first question, I want to go back to the DCG ASPs in the December quarter.",". 

What is the growth rate for DCG ASPs in the December quarter?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: There were up 4% year-over-year, which reverses, I think, a four or five quarter trend of ASPs going down. I know that you've had mix headwinds that have been driving blended ASPs down. I am curious, what happened the fourth-quarter to drive ASPs up, and do you think it is sustainable? Is this just what we would expect to see the first quarter of the Broadwell launch? And then it normalizes going forward? Or how do you think about ASPs from here?                                          
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [36]
                                                   I will let Bob start with this, and then I will come in and talk a little bit about the macro view of this.                                          
Bob Swan,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [37]
                                                   Two dynamics in the fourth quarter where we had higher ASPs.",.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: One, the continued transition from Haswell to Broadwell is helpful, and then as we project forward,  the next transition is Skylake   we believe will be helpful as well. So those dynamics where we're delivering better performance for our customers, we are able to capture some of that in ASPs. And we saw a little bit of that in the fourth quarter. 
And secondly, in the coms and network space, which is a share-gain opportunity for us in DSG, getting those clients to move up the stack in terms of the high-performance server CPUs is the second dynamic. Both of which we think are helpful as we exit 2016, and go into 2017.",".

Q: What are your thoughts on the transition from Haswell to Broadwell?
A: We believe that the transition from Haswell to Broadwell is helpful, as it delivers better performance for our customers. This is captured in ASPs, and we saw a little bit of that in the fourth quarter.

Q: What are your thoughts on the transition from Skylake to Kaby Lake?
A: We believe that the transition from Skylake to Kaby Lake will be helpful as well. This is because we believe that the next transition, Kaby Lake, will be even better than Skylake. This is because we expect more performance gains for our customers."

                                                   Yes the only thing I would add, John, is, we'll as we go back into the second half of this year; do the Skylake transition. And that is a technology that will increase performance, and a performance per cost to our customers   one of the largest improvement in a long time, if not ever, on the Data Center. 
So, we expect   typically when that happens people see the value in that and they tend to buy up. They tend to buy the better SKUs. To my view, this trend of higher mix should continue.                                          
John Pitzer,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [39]
                                                   That's helpful. And then maybe as my follow-up, Brian, relative to the guide, you're kind of expecting a significant drop in free cash flow this year, with the increase in CapEx.",".

Question: What is the expected decrease in free cash flow this year?
Answer: We expect a significant decrease in free cash flow this year."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And you highlighted that CapEx is going to the non-volatile memory group. 
I'm just curious, given that business, even though it made some improvements in losses in the calendar fourth quarter, is still in a loss position. I'm assuming the higher CapEx is going to be a headwind to getting to profitability.  But I guess, how do you think about the path to profitability? The longer-term business model in memory? And what it might do to the DCG growth rate longer term if Xpoint is successful?                                          
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [40]
                                                   Sure. Let's talk about memory in kind of a big picture, John, and then we can   I'll let Bob talk a little bit about how the CapEx weighs, and what our view of CapEx is in this space. 
But, we are in this space for one reason.",".

1. What is Intel's rationale for investing in memory?
2. How will increased CapEx impact the company's profitability?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Because, I understand it is a cyclical business, that tends to be fairly difficult from a price-capacity standpoint. But, we believe we are coming at it with two, very unique technologies. Our 3D NAND technology has some of the best performance and best cost in the market. Our current version of 3D NAND has a 15% price   or cost value over the competition, and our next version, second-generation has even a higher, when you look at it on a density basis. 
And so, we believe we are going to be able to bring differential cost and performance in 3D NAND that will give us a unique position. And that combined with our knowledge of the Data Center should allow us to really provide compelling products for Data Center SSDs.",".

Question: What is the next version of 3D NAND?
Answer: The next version of 3D NAND is second-generation."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
3D Xpoint is very different in that it's a unique technology that bridges between memory and storage. And, we believe it can rearchitect how big data applications, artificial intelligence applications where you want large amounts of data being brought up as close to the compute as you can, will really transform, not only the architecture of those systems but the performance of those systems. 
And we have demonstrated on stage, even on client systems using these types of SSDs, on a equal price, you can get 5x to 7x performance improvement using 3D Xpoint as a large memory storage, kind of, combination. 
So we are investing, surely because we believe we have this differential technology, and that is why we are in this business.",".

Question: What is the difference between 3D Xpoint and other memory technologies?

Answer: 3D Xpoint is a unique technology that bridges between memory and storage. This allows for big data applications and artificial intelligence applications to be run closer to the compute, resulting in improved performance."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: I think, if I did not have that differential, I'm not sure it is a business that Intel would necessarily be in. Right? But with that leadership, and we believe we could sustain that leadership. We believe it is a good business and a good investment. 
I'll have Bob talk about how long and how we view the capital.                                          
Bob Swan,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [41]
                                                   So yes, John. The CapEx dynamic, first kind of at the macro level, up $2.5 billion year-on-year, driven by two things. One, memory, obviously. But also bringing10nm capacity online. 
If I just go down a level to memory. Roughly, $1.6 billion CapEx in 2016. Expectation is it will be roughly $2.5 billion in 2017, as we bring the incremental capacity online.",".

Question: What is the expectation for CapEx in 2017? 
Answer: The expectation is that CapEx will be roughly $2.5 billion in 2017."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Then as we look at memory specifically, in 2018 we think it begins to drop off a little bit, as we focus that capacity on 3D NAND and increasingly 3D Xpoint.

Vivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [45]
                                                   Thanks for taking my question. Brian, I'm curious with this new US administration. There is a lot of interest in using US-made products."," that could be impacted by the new administration.

What impact, if any, do you think the new administration will have on Intel's plans to focus on 3D NAND and 3D Xpoint?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And since you are fairly sizable fabs here in the US, I am wondering how you can take advantage of this environment, or if you are interested in making a bigger push in your foundry business?                                          
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [46]
                                                   Well, we are always open for business in foundry. And we are always interested   remember we said our foundry strategy was really to be on the leading edge. So, because we can get paid for our technology, and it really allows us to use our unique differentiation in that space. 
Beyond that, I would just tell you we have always been proud. It is not a new transition or new strategy for Intel. We have always been roughly between, a little more than half to two-thirds of our capacity in the US.",".

1. What is Intel's strategy for foundry business?
2. How much of Intel's capacity is in the US?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We are the second largest exporter in the US. And we are proud of that position. But other than that, there is no real shift in our strategy right now.                                          
Vivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [47]
                                                   All right. And as my follow-up, back to DCG. There seem to be two moving pieces. You have this declining, but very profitable Enterprise part, but a faster growth, but perhaps less-profitable networking, and cloud and other areas. Is that fair characterization? And do you envision a point at which the non-Enterprise parts become dominant enough that you can actually see an acceleration in DCG back to your traditional double-digit type growth rate?                                          
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [48]
                                                   So let me start, and then we can see. I think our view is that Enterprise will continue to decline.",.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: A lot of that is those workloads moving to the cloud. It will get to a point where it starts to stabilize and those   because there are still things that   workloads that will want to be in a private cloud. 
At the same time, we believe as the world becomes connected, cloud will grow at a much faster rate. And, I made a point in the prepared remarks, where if you look at the cloud of today, seeing mostly based on people   the average person will generate about 1.5 GB of data a day. An autonomous car, when those things start hitting the road, and we've  started to build these Data Centers for some of the trials we're working with.",":

What will be the average person's data output by the end of 2020? 1.5 GB/day"
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And you are talking about petabytes of data that you are having to deal with, and 4,000 GB a day off the average autonomous car. You put a couple of those on the road, and you need petabytes of storage to handle that. 
So we do believe that the cloud will move at a faster rate as these connected devices become, basically, more available. That said, the cloud is becoming bigger than Enterprise. We said Enterprise is now less than 50%. And we believe the other areas that will grow, networking and storage, the adjacencies like Omni-Path fabric, Silicon Photonics, Rack Scale Design, which we're working with our partners on, it really lowers the cost of the system and rearchitects how the Rack is laid out.",".

Question: What is the percentage of Enterprise that Intel Corp believes will grow?
Answer: Intel Corp believes that the cloud will move at a faster rate as these connected devices become, basically, more available."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
And 3D Xpoint should dramatically   that will drive the growth for us, as we go through the rest of this decade. We believe when you add those up together, this thing will go back to double digits. Went exactly that is? Because it's pretty hard   we're trying to grow these new nascent areas, and manage the decline of Enterprise. It's going to be hard to call exactly when. But we do still have a strong belief, and we believe the products are very compelling, that these will drive us to double-digit growth long-term.                                          
Bob Swan,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [49]
                                                   The only thing I would add, Brian, is on like-for-like product, ASPs have a tendency to be lower to the cloud service providers, but at the same time the cloud service providers really value performance.",".

What is Intel's outlook for like-for-like product sales in the second half of 2016?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And in terms of the mix of their products, they will value performance in the higher-end products more than maybe Enterprise as a whole.

Secondly, we will continue to look at M&A that will strengthen our capabilities so that is no different than the past. Third, in terms of capital returns, our expectation has been, and I think will continue to think it this way going forward as it relates to dividend, grow it in line with non-GAAP earnings. And have it be roughly 40% of the free cash flow for the Company   those change around the margins over time depending on the CapEx intensity of the business. 
But I don't expect that to change, and we will continue to look at how we move the dividend in line with that philosophy. As I said earlier, in terms of the more holistic capital returns bucket, we will continue to offset dilution, which I think is pretty consistent with what we have done in the past.",".

Question: What is the expectation for capital returns, including dividends, in fiscal year 2017?
Answer: Our expectation has been, and I think will continue to think it this way going forward as it relates to dividend, grow it in line with non-GAAP earnings. And have it be roughly 40% of the free cash flow for the Company."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
And then third, we have a great balance sheet. And I do think that, opportunistically, when it makes sense, reducing our outstanding float is an opportunity we have as we get closer to the net-cash zero position that we have been tracking towards over the last 12 months since the Altera acquisition. 
So, philosophically no dramatic change. Dividend in line with non-GAAP earnings growth. But trying to stay in that roughly 40% free cash flow world. And maybe if opportunities present itself, be opportunistic in share counts without limiting our financial flexibility relative to the things that matter most, which is strengthening our business.

                                                   Operator, I think we have time for two more questions.                                          
Operator    [57]
                                                   Harlan Sur, JPMorgan.                                          
Bill Peterson,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [58]
                                                   Hi. Good afternoon. This is Bill Peterson, calling for Harlan. Congratulations on the nice quarter. 
Coming back to the storage market. Trying to understand how you view growth this year in light of, obviously, good sequential growth in the prior quarter, but also overlaying that with the Optane qualifications that are going on in progress. How should we view that as terms of the incremental growth driver in 2017?                                          
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [59]
                                                   Sure, So if you take a look at it   as I said, this is a cyclical market. If you take a look at 2016, it started out with an oversupply.",.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Came into the back half of the year with an under-supply, really, of capacity. 
We are entering 2017 with a continued tightness in supply. That makes pricing stable to better. So, we expect that, at least, right now the estimates are through the first half. It's pretty hard to project out to the second half, and so we have kind of kept the second half relatively calm and cautious. 
If you take a look at 3D Xpoint, as we said we've qualified. We've started to ship DIMM samples to the big cloud service guys. Those are targeted for 2018 revenue shipment. On an SSD basis, we will start shipping for revenue this quarter. And, if you take a look at the full year, I think the estimate is, it's around 10% of our total revenue is 3D Xpoint.",".

Question: What is the percentage of total revenue that 3D Xpoint will account for in 2017?
Answer: 10%"
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
And that will be   it could take off and it could be a little more than that. It could take a little while to qualify some things if it's a little off. But you should think it is around 10% of the revenue. And really, ramping much more into 2018. 
What we are proud of, is you get past that first hurdle of getting the first one to production ready, and starting to ship samples to the cloud guys, and actually getting ready to start shipping SSDs for revenue to the client devices and all that. We are pretty excited about just getting to that point right now with 3D Xpoint.                                          
Bill Peterson,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [60]
                                                   I appreciate the color.                                          
Bob Swan,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [61]
                                                   The full-year for memory was down 1%, 2016 over 2015.",".

What was the decrease in memory revenue in 2016 compared to 2015?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: But the momentum that you saw is that supply chain dynamic that Brian highlighted changed. And as we began to scale our own capabilities, you saw the strong exit growth of 25% in the fourth quarter. 
And so with that going into 2017, we feel pretty good about that growth rate in the fourth quarter, as we enter the new year.                                          
Bill Peterson,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [62]
                                                   Great. I appreciate the color on that. Maybe a question on the Programmable Solutions. The group has shown sequential declines in the prior two quarters versus your main competitor, who has shown sequential growth, albeit modestly. Discuss taking share    and now you have the 14nm-based product. I wonder if you could provide color on maybe why that group has lagged in the prior few quarters.",".

Intel Corp. (INTC) reported fourth quarter 2016 earnings of $3.06 per share on revenue of $16.5 billion. This compares to earnings of $3.27 per share on revenue of $16.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015. The company's net income was $4.1 billion, or $4.47 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to net income of $3.7 billion, or $4.14 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Intel's fourth quarter 2016 results were driven by strong exit growth of 25% in the fourth quarter. This growth was supported by strong demand for our products in the data center and mobile markets, as well as continued growth in the global cloud market.

Looking forward, we are confident in our momentum and expect continued growth in the data center and mobile markets, as well as the global cloud market in 2017."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: But more importantly,  when we should see the inflection in the business and how to think about growth in that business this year.                                          
Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [63]
                                                   So, let's talk about that. If I look at 2016, as we showed, we had about 7% growth over what Altera had in 2015. If you take a look at it, there is a couple of big segments that are driving that, Telco, Data Center, and we are starting to see   and in the networking space as well. Those a kind of the big three segments. 
And we started to see as we went through, especially the back of the year, a good connection between our ability to go in, and we are better together,  with Xeon and the FPGA, as we go into that networking space.",".

Q: What are your thoughts on the inflection point in the business this year?
A: We think there is a good chance that we will see some growth in the business this year."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Again, as our footprint grows in networking and storage, I think it also gives us an ability to continue to bring both products to those markets. 
So, we think in 2016, we actually gained share relative to the competition. As we look out into 2017, we forecasted again, above market growth from what we understand, as a current estimate. And we believe we will gain a little bit of share, again, in 2017. And, remember these markets are slow-moving. You don't grow 10% share instantly, because of design cycles and design conversions are relatively difficult. 
It is again driven by Data Center, Networking, and the telco industry. And with Stratix 10, as we said, largest design enablement in the history of Altera, so we are really excited.",".

Question: What is your outlook for the networking and storage markets in 2016 and 2017?
Answer: We forecasted again, above market growth from what we understand, as a current estimate. And we believe we will gain a little bit of share, again, in 2017."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We believe it brings a performance and a cost to our customers, that is truly industry-leading and shifting.  And, so we are very comfortable   or confident in that, but again that will really start to shift in the second half of 2017. And so, I think that will really be driving growth in 2018. 
And really if you think about these design cycles, that product will really continue to drive growth for probably the next three years, plus, just because these cycles are fairly long.

Intel Corp. generated $16.5 billion in revenue in Q4 2016, up from $15.9 billion in Q4 2015. The company expects revenue to grow by mid-single digits in 2017 and 2018."

Blayne Curtis,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [68]
                                                   Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I want to ask, Bob, on the gross margin, your full year is equal to the Q1. Just maybe, as you look in the back half, I want to make sure I heard it straight. 
It sounded like 14 on the server side. May have some initial yields, and that would be headwind, but I am curious on the PC client as well. So maybe you could just talk about the puts and takes as you ramp in 10, but you still ship a lot of 14.",".

Hi, thanks for having me. I wanted to clarify that our full year gross margin is 14%, which is the same as in Q1. We do have some initial yields associated with our products, but we're still ramping up production of these products. So while there may be some headwinds at first, we're confident that we'll be able to generate strong cash flow over the long term. Thanks again for having me."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: As you look in the second half, what are the headwinds and tailwinds to gross margin?                                          
Bob Swan,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [69]
                                                   Yes The two tailwinds on the year-on-year are flat, ASPs being a little better, and we anticipate that more on the DCG side. Secondly, unit cost being a little bit better, and we anticipate that more on the CCG side. And again, as I mentioned earlier, for DCG as we transition more from 22nm to 14nm, all else equal, that will be a little bit of a headwind in the early stages of yield for server on 14nm. 
The headwinds, particularly, are strong growth coming from memory and modem.",".

What are the headwinds and tailwinds to gross margin?

The two tailwinds on the year-on-year are flat, ASPs being a little better, and we anticipate that more on the DCG side. Secondly, unit cost being a little bit better, and we anticipate that more on the CCG side."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So those two dynamics, themselves: good growth, increasing profitability, good earnings, however, they are at a lower margin so the mix dynamic of those are real on a year-over-year basis. So, good ASP, good unit cost, but mix is a challenge. 
And then year-on-year factory ramp, 10nm and memory are a headwind for the full year, but it gets a little bit better in the second half. The dynamic to first-half, second-half   it gets a little bit better in the second half.                                          
Blayne Curtis,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [70]
                                                   Thanks, and then just maybe a clarification.",".

What is the mix dynamic of Intel's earnings?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: The $3 billion that you are getting from the sale, should I assume that goes to debt retirement like you have been using your cash flow? And, then I guess, you should get at some point this year, potentially the end the year, near that net-cash zero. Should we think about buybacks at that point?                                          
Bob Swan,  Intel Corporation - CFO    [71]
                                                   I think the dynamics of the $3 billion, the intention is that roughly $1 billion comes in line at time of transaction. And that we will provide dollar financing in the early stages. So we will only get roughly $1 billion upfront. 
In terms of then, just the net debt position during the course of the year, you can assume that we have some maturities in 2015   sorry 2017 that we will take out.",".

Q: So you're saying that the $1 billion that you will get from the sale will go towards debt retirement?
A: That's correct."
Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And we believe by the end of the year, given those dynamics, we will be closer to a net-cash zero position. 
In terms of that, and that gives us a much stronger balance sheet, and how we think about that. We will continue, as I said earlier, invest in business, return capital to shareholders, and opportunistically, whether it is reducing outstanding float   that's one that we'll continue to look at and be opportunistic as opportunities present themselves.

What is the core NAND business returning to profitability?
The core NAND business is returning to profitability after acquisition-related impacts."
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Let me remind you of our capital allocation priorities and progress. Our priorities: first, invest in the business; second, strategic acquisitions; and third, return cash to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. As I mentioned earlier, in the quarter we generated $4.7 billion of cash from operations. We purchased $2.8 billion in capital assets, paid $1.3 billion in dividends and repurchased about $1.3 billion of stocks. In addition, we received cash of approximately $900 million as a portion of our Intel Security divestiture. And we generated approximately $1.3 billion from the sales of some of our interest in ASML, which generated $796 million of pretax gains. At quarter end, cash and long-term investments was $34 billion, up $11 billion, and total debt was $32 billion.","

What is the company's capital allocation priority?

The company's capital allocation priority is to invest in the business, make strategic acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks."
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Offshore cash investments and proceeds from the sale of our ASML investments are being used to fund the Mobileye acquisition.
Now let me turn to guidance on Slide 9. Some context. First, while we see slightly higher PC TAM and supply chain inventory replenishment contributing to higher expectations for annual revenue, we continue to take a more cautious view of PC consumption versus third-party analysts. Second, we continue to see strong demand signals in our memory business through the year, and we expect the memory fab in Dalian to support higher second half demand levels. And third, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to close the acquisition of Mobileye in the third quarter and as such are including expectations for this business into our guidance.",".

Question: What is the reason for the cautious view of PC consumption versus third-party analysts?
Answer: The cautious view is due to the fact that PC TAM and supply chain inventory replenishment are higher than expected, while PC demand is seen as strong."
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Based on these factors, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by $1.3 billion to $61.3 billion, operating income guidance by $600 million to $17.9 billion and EPS guidance by $0.15 to $3 per share. The improvement in revenue outlook is driven by a strong first half, higher expectations of the PC business and the inclusion of Mobileye. The improvement in operating margin is primarily driven by our increased revenue outlook.
Our outlook for full year spending is $20.7 billion, as we expect modest increases related to revenue growth and the integration of Mobileye. The increase in EPS is driven by higher expectations of revenue, coupled with gains on sale of our equity investments and the inclusion of Mobileye.",".

Question: What is the main reason for the increase in revenue guidance?
Answer: The main reason for the increase in revenue guidance is a strong first half, higher expectations of the PC business and the inclusion of Mobileye."
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We expect Mobileye to contribute approximately $200 million of revenue, $100 million of operating income and $0.02 of EPS in the second half of the year.

As is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and a follow-up if you have one. Crystal, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner. 
                                        
Questions and Answers
                                        
Operator    [1]
                                                   Our first question comes from Blayne Curtis from Barclays.",".

1. What is the company's strategy for expanding its data-centric businesses?
2. What are the benefits of this strategy?"
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call:                                         
Blayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst    [2]
                                                   I was curious on the   on the data center business, maybe you can just talk about the growth you need sequentially in the back half to get to that high single digits for the year. Maybe you can just talk about it by segment. I know cloud was up a lot in Q2, the enterprise down. Clarify by segment as well as the contribution from scalable into those segments. What's the right timing to think about as those ramp in?                                         
Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]
                                                   Sure. Thanks, Blayne, for the question. So I'll start, and Bob can add some comments at the end. We think the data center continues to be just a great growth engine for the company.",".

What is the growth rate you need sequentially in the back half to get to high single digits for the year?"
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And you saw the 9% growth this quarter. What we have really been also focusing on at the same time is really increasing operating margin, and I want to make that point. You saw our operating margin increased to 38% this quarter. You'll see us continue to raise that operating margin so that we're back at the 40-plus-percent operating margin for the back half and for the year. First, kind of want to kind of lay that groundwork. What we've projected for the second half is quarters that are pretty much in line. We continue to expect enterprise to continue to decline. It declined a bit more in the second quarter than   I think we had really projected a decline at about 11%.",".

Question: What's driving the increase in operating margin?

Answer: We're really focusing on increasing operating margin, and that's really been driven by a number of things. One is really increasing our efficiency, and we've been doing a lot of work on that. We've also been focusing on increasing our sales and marketing efforts, and we're seeing those investments pay off."
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: But if you look at Q1, it declined a little less than we expected at 3%, but we still expect it to decline in those high single-digit numbers. Cloud though grew greater than what we expected at 36%. We expect it to be in the mid-20s, probably more likely. And then data center   I mean networking and comms, 17%. Adjacencies at 12%. So we expect that trend to continue. We don't need any big shift in those trends to really get to that high single-digit growth rate for the data center. We talked about Xeon Scalable. The initial reaction has been extremely positive. You see the largest number of prequalification samples sent out to customers. You see the cloud applications. We try to talk about it. It's the largest performance improvement in a decade gen-to-gen.",".

Question: What is the largest performance improvement in a decade gen-to-gen?

Answer: The largest performance improvement in a decade gen-to-gen is the Xeon Scalable."
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So we're seeing a very large ramp in the second half as we move on with the Xeon Scalable.

                                                   The only thing I would add, Brian, is we came into the year looking at high single-digit growth for the business and margins expanding quarter-by-quarter throughout the year. And kind of 2 months in, we see nice acceleration on both top and bottom line. And as we go into the second half of the year, we're comfortable with the full year outlook that we've given.",".

Q: What are your thoughts on the Xeon Scalable's potential in the datacenter?
A: We're seeing a very large ramp in the second half as we move on with the Xeon Scalable. And so I think that's what's going to fuel second half '17. And then we see it continuing into '18 as well. So I think that's kind of how we see the second half playing out."
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And the only dynamic other than the things Brian highlighted as Q3 comps are a little tougher as we enter the second half of the year, but we feel good about kind of the mix of the business as we go through '17 and beyond. Just to reiterate a point Brian said, with the strong cloud growth and the strong performance in the comms and networking space, we now generate 60% of our revenues from the higher-growth aspects of the business. So we think that, that bears well for us in 2017 but also going into '18 and beyond.

                                                   Sure. So let's make sure we clarify, right? So on traditional NAND, we are breakeven this year, and we broke even actually this quarter. And we expect to remain there the rest of the year. When we talk about for next year, that's inclusive of 3D XPoint.",".

Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And so the difference is really as we ramp products on 3D XPoint and as we ramp out the rest of Fab 68, both of those   whenever you're ramping a factory, you always   because you have a certain amount of underutilization of the equipment just as you start to get it going, you tend to have slightly higher cost. And so that's what you see as the driver for the rest of the profitability growth as we go into next year. And what I'll also say that the 64-tier NAND product gives us cost and performance advantage just because they're leading-edge products as well. Now it's going to play into as we move to the remainder of this year and next year.",".

Question: What is the difference between the profitability growth you're seeing now and what you're expecting in the future?

Answer: We're expecting continued profitability growth in the coming years as we ramp products on 3D XPoint and as we ramp out the rest of Fab 68."
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So it's 64-tier products on traditional NAND, the ramp out of Fab 68 and then the real start-up and continuation and getting the rest of the products qualified on 3D XPoint is what gets us everything profitable next year.

The trend of   look, enterprise is going to continue to decline.

I think you'll see quarters like Q2 that was 11%. You'll see quarters like Q1 that were 3% or 4%. We've seen quarters higher than the 11% over the last couple of years. So it's going to be lumpy as we see this shift, but the overall macro shift of enterprise to cloud or traditional on-prem systems to cloud is going to continue.",".

As we think about the full year with revenues going up, why isn't gross margin changing at all?

A: The combination of the incremental growth and the addition of Mobileye are the primary drivers for the slightly higher spend."
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And with that $1.8 billion, there'll be roughly $200 million of costs, primarily Mobileye. So in context, we feel like we're managing the cost and spending side of the business effectively as we position to a 30% spending of revenue by 2020 at the latest. In terms of the gross margin dynamics, I think the trends that you've seen over the last couple of quarters we expect to continue through the year. And it's really ASP improvements, good unit cost performance, volume leverage to the fab kind of working in our favor. And on the flip side, the strong growth of the memory and the modem business and the ramp cost for 10-nanometer are partial offsets. Those dynamics are what has driven the strong gross margins in the 63% range in the first half.",".

Question: What are the ASP improvements that have driven the strong gross margins in the 63% range in the first half?

Answer: The strong gross margins in the 63% range in the first half are due to ASP improvements, good unit cost performance, volume leverage to the fab, and ASP improvements for memory and modem products."

There's been a lot of discussion about AMD perhaps posing more competition than it has in the last several years. And I appreciate it's early days and you have a very strong product out. But are you hearing about them more in your customer conversations? Is that a more real threat than it has been in the past? Because they did have an event, they did show up with 10-plus potential customers.",".

                                                   Sure, Vivek. So I think in general we see competition across almost every one of our platforms, whether it be in the data center or in the client business. And it's come from a variety of sources. You're right, AMD has kind of raised up a bit with their more recent products, but you see us responding. This is a traditional performance battle that we're very accustomed to and we're comfortable in reacting and competing very aggressively in. And so you see us coming out with our Xeon Scalable.",".

And we're comfortable that we can make the right products to deliver the right performance against those.

We   the yields on 10 nanometers are continuing to improve pretty much right in line with the forecasted ramp rates. It's a new technology, so you always have some problems to go solve, but we're pretty comfortable with where we're at right now. Like we said in the earnings script, we are set to qualify the first production products right at   right towards the end of the year. You'll see those start to ship in the first half of next year, and you'll see a ramp of SKUs.

We did indicate that approximately $2.5 billion of that would be for memory. So underlying that, you have $9.5 billion CapEx for the logic business.",".

Question: What SKUs will be the first to feature 10-nanometer products?

Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: For 10 nanometer, specifically, you have TD lines and pilot lines going in this year and beginning to scale, as we match the capacity with the production that scales in the first half and second half of next year. So that's reflected in the CapEx guide and the depreciation guide that we gave you earlier in the year, and that hasn't really changed.

                                                   Any it needs to build inventory to do that?                                         
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [28]
                                                   I think the inventory levels as we see it in the channel is slightly higher than the lean levels they've been for the last couple of quarters, but no dramatic difference from our perspective on how we see PC TAM for the full year.

                                                   Our next question comes from John Pitzer from CrÃ©dit Suisse.                                         
John William Pitzer,  CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [30]
                                                   Brian, I apologize if I missed this in your prepared comments. My first question is just around pricing in DCG. It was down about 1% sequentially. There's always a lot of mixed things there.",".

What is Intel's view of the PC market in terms of pricing and demand?"
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: You usually have some commentary about ASPs per bucket. Were they still strong? And I guess more importantly, as you think about the product launches in the back half of the year, at least some of our initial checks are suggesting that customers are kind of chomping at the bit to high   to buy higher up into the stack, which could drive some good ASPs. Can you talk about your expectations around ASPs and/or attach rates for adjacency data center businesses with the launch of the Xeon Scalable?                                         
Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [31]
                                                   Sure, John.",".

Question: What are your expectations for ASPs for the back half of the year? 
Answer: We expect ASPs for the back half of the year to be strong."
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So we expect the second half of 2017, from an ASP perspective, to be pretty much what you've seen in the past where ASPs continue to increase on the various platforms of Xeon, right? So looking at each one, you'll see ASPs overall increasing. What you're seeing on this is a little bit of mix, right? So as you saw networking and storage grow at 17%, the adjacencies at 12%, those are starting to become a little bit more percentage of that business, and those draw down overall ASPs a little bit. But if you look within just the Xeon core function, those ASPs continue to decline   to increase at about the normal rates that you'd expect as we move into   especially as you move into a new architectural like Xeon Scalable.",".

Question: What is the expected ASP growth for Xeon in the second half of 2017?

Answer: We expect the second half of 2017, from an ASP perspective, to be pretty much what you've seen in the past where ASPs continue to increase on the various platforms of Xeon."
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call:

                                                   That's helpful. And for my follow-on, just turning to the client compute group. Your ability to sort of segment that market and drive higher mix has been sort of a multiyear endeavor with a lot of success. What inning do you think you guys are in, in that process, especially with AMD coming to market with new product? Is there still a mix   a potential story here? And what would drive that?                                         
Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [33]
                                                   I actually think there is. I think if you take a look at this, John, what's driven this has not been clever segmentation necessarily. It's been the ability to segment into specific markets and specific performance.",".

What would drive that? The ability to generate higher mix. So if you look at the data, we've been able to drive mix higher by increasing the share of our products in specific markets. And I think that's something that we'll continue to do."
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And so things like Core i9 are a good example, where you're really targeting performance. And so what you   what I believe is that what   the growth areas in the client space gaming, virtual reality, thin and light, they're requiring performance and power. And remember, those are always somewhat tradable as you take a look at the   and so those trends are going to continue. And that's why   that's   as we talk about how do you feel about competition, where do you see competition playing, we believe our leadership in performance will continue to allow that trend to continue and continuing to allow the trend within CCG to continue as well. And that's part of what drove the forecast for the second half.                                         
Operator    [34]
                                                   Our next question comes from Romit Shah from Nomura Securities.

What is Intel's outlook for the second half of 2017?"
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Ltd., Research Division - Executive Director    [35]
                                                   It looks like this is the fifth consecutive quarter that CCG beat expectations. Revenues were up 12%. And I think there's a debate out there as to whether or not you deserve credit for this performance, with skeptics really pointing toward   to sustainability more than anything else. When you break down that 12%, as you guys mentioned, ASPs are a big part of the increase. My question is as you look at sort of the mix in that business overall is there room to drive ASPs higher and effectively capture more value inside of the PC TAM?                                         
Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [36]
                                                   So yes, is the simple answer, Romit. Remember, this isn't necessarily us raising prices.",".

1. What is the main reason for CCG's increased revenues in the past five quarters?
2. What are the main factors that contribute to ASPs being higher in CCG's PC business?"
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So it's not we're out there and going and saying, ""Okay, I'm going to charge $10 more for the next Core i7."" It's actually the percentage of units that are being bought at those higher units. And we continue to deliver higher performance at the same price with each one of these generations. So what you're seeing is actually an overall trend that, yes, units are down. We talked about that, both [Brian] and Bob, around TAM being down somewhere in that low- to mid-single-digit range. And that's pretty much in line with what I'm seeing third parties. Sure, some third parties are a little bit better than that. But for the most part, we're within a couple of percent. But yes, we believe that there is room for continued demand for movement upwards.",".

Question: What is the percentage of units that are being bought at those higher units?

Answer: The percentage of units that are being bought at those higher units is actually increasing."
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So if you a numbers of Core i7s, a number of Core i9, the number of people buying the performance thin and light laptops, those are going to continue. And you see it in our OEM partners and the type of systems they're producing and the type of systems they're bringing to market. Now they're targeting that more and more as well.                                         
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [37]
                                                   The only thing I would add is, again, we have a business that has a declining market. It's growing not by raising prices but, to Brian's point, by a market that increasingly values performance. And the operating margins of the business for the first half of the year were up over 50%. So this team through its segmentation is executing extremely well.",".

What is the market that increasingly values performance?"
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And then as we mentioned earlier, yes, with that great margin performance, we are redeploying our resources to invest in these data-centric set of businesses that have high-growth characteristics that collectively were up 16% again in the quarter. And through this journey of a PC TAM decline, we have a bigger business, a stronger business and a more profitable business, with an increasing portion, over 40%, coming from high-growth-oriented businesses. So great performance in a declining market, continuing to invest in it and reallocate across our portfolio and feel good about our   the portfolio we have and with the addition of Mobileye as we head into the second half of the year.                                         
Romit Jitendra Shah,  Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - Executive Director    [38]
                                                   And in terms like   you obviously provide ASPs for CCG.",".

What is the ASP for CCG?

The ASP for CCG is $1,000."
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: But is the core mix as a percentage of units a metric that we should be focusing on? And I   if I remember correctly, that percentage was close to 70%. I'm curious where it is today.                                         
Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [39]
                                                   Yes, it's continuing to climb. It is, but don't forget even within that core mix, Romit, you have the ability to continue to scale up, so Core i3 versus Core i5 versus Core i7. And now we've introduce the Core i9, right, which is even a higher performance. So we saw earlier on people choosing Core over Pentium or Atom, for example, and you saw the core mix move up.",".

Q: What is the percentage of Core i9 processors in the total number of processors sold?
A: The Core i9 processor represents a very small percentage of total processor sales."
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: You're now seeing not only that continue to climb, but you're going to see within Core the amount of Core i7s, Core i9s, Core i5s continue to climb as well. And that's why we continue to see that there's legs behind this.","

What is Intel's guidance for the rest of the year?"
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And you kind of said, hey, are we getting credit for this, right? We don't think when you look at overall this business, last year's performance with great growth in all of the segments, you look at this year's performance so far in the first half and our projections now in the second half, we think that our ability to segment, to drive better operating margin and to continue to drive performance into the PC and keep it more and more profitable while we invest and grow these other businesses, we think that there's an option around Intel that is quite good.

                                                   In DCG, you guys are probably full throttle from a manufacturing perspective for Xeon Scalable, or Skylake, in the June quarter. But my question is how much of the data center growth in June was the initial production revenue shipments of Xeon Scalable to your customers? Or did that contribute just very little to the June quarter mix?                                         
Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [42]
                                                   Okay. Yes. It's very little. We don't give out exact percentages by SKU like that. But I can genuinely tell you that it is really just the beginning of the ramp of the Xeon Scalable. And so its impact into Q2 was minimal at best.",".

A: It's very little. We don't give out exact percentages by SKU like that."
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: What you'll see is as it ramps into the second half it becomes a higher and higher percentage. And really, the big volume is going to be 2018. So that's when it really takes over from way   the way the data center looks from a revenue and profit standpoint. What we're excited about is   we talked about the 500,000 units that are out there. That was the highest number of pre-samples. That shows you the demand by the big infrastructure guys around the performance.","

What is the 500,000 units that are out there?

The 500,000 units that are out there are the highest number of pre-samples that Intel has ever released. This shows the demand for Intel's performance products by the big infrastructure guys around the world."
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: They were willing to take the product even before, ""We are ready to start shipping it."" And then the number of records we've broken already in performance, we talked about 50 records worldwide already, those are laying the groundwork for how this ramp is going to look and feel as we move into the second half and into '18.                                         
Harlan Sur,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [43]
                                                   And good to see the profitability in the NAND segment. In enterprise SSD, I think you guys are still the #2 global market share leader there. And it looks like based on the first half performance you guys are outpacing the market.",".

2. How did the company's first half performance compare to the market?"
Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So I guess the question is, where's the team winning? Is it high capacity? Is it high performance for these enterprise and cloud drives? And similar to maybe some of your peers, is the team currently capacity constrained?

                                                   Sure. So our whole strategy around the memory is that we are focused on differentiation and performance and specifically around supporting the data center. We do sell into client as well, but that's not the main focus of this business. And so I tell you that's   when we talk about our growth and when we talk about our projections for the rest of this year and why we're investing in the future, that 64-tier NAND gives us the ability to be a better cost but at the high-performance end.",".

It's really focused towards the data center products. Even still, there's   not all SSDs and data centers are high-end performance. So we're comfortable with where we are in the market share. We want to balance those investments against the demand for these high-performance areas and make sure we stay   we keep that in balance. And our real goal is then to move more and more of the business towards the 3D XPoint as we move into next year because that really differentiates us again as we really change the hierarchy between memory and storage as the data center DIMM memory systems come out.

By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO earnings presentation, which replaces the CFO commentary that we provided in the past. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our Investor website, intc.com. The CFO earnings presentation is also available in the webcast window for those joining us online.
I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Bob Swan, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by the Q&A."," for each of the following topics.

1. Intel's third quarter results
2. The company's outlook for the fourth quarter and full year
3. Recent developments in the PC market

1. Intel's third quarter results

Brian, could you give us a brief overview of Intel's third quarter results?

Intel's third quarter results were solid, with revenue up 7% year-over-year and operating income up 14%. We generated strong cash flow and returned $5.1 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We're seeing continued growth in our data center and client computing segments, with both revenue and operating income up significantly year-over-year. We're also seeing good growth in our mobile business, with both revenue and operating income up significantly quarter-over-quarter.

                                                   BK, a longer-term one for you. You rattled off a number of AI advancements that Intel is having, whether it be on the Nervana side or the Stratix side. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment in there? You mentioned that it's not going to be one size fit all   fits all. But if you could give a little bit of how Intel does have an advantage versus some of the early movers in that space? And then perhaps more importantly, when will we, externally as investors, be able to start to see the financial benefits of these new products?

That part we put out so far is really a chip for people to begin to use and learn how to program with neuromorphic, which is a very different type of machine learning. It lets you learn at hundreds of times faster rate than traditional, I'll say, GPUs and CPUs, especially around visual learning. Those as well, you'll start to see next   late next year and beyond, as people really begin to learn how to program with these. So seeing it already and those newer products, I really think late '18 and beyond before they really start to hit P&Ls.

What is the company's outlook for OpEx in the next fiscal year?

Intel expects OpEx to be in the range of $16 billion to $18 billion in the next fiscal year."
Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And congrats on the great operating leverage in the quarter. As we think about the way you can get that operating leverage in the past, Intel seems to have focused mainly on keeping the OpEx relatively flat, and then revenue growth driving that leverage. But in the quarter and then the guide that you just delivered, it looks like OpEx is down about 6% year-over-year. Conceptually, as we go into the next couple of years, how do you think investors should think about the balance of delivering that cadence up to the 30% mark that you're looking for over the next couple of years? Is it more revenue growth? Or you are you indeed going to be cutting the absolute level of OpEx?

Question: How do you think investors should think about the balance of delivering that cadence up to the 30% mark that you're looking for over the next couple of years? 
Answer: Intel plans to achieve 30% operating leverage by increasing revenue growth and reducing operating expenses."
Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: First, as you mentioned, we had great progress in the third quarter. We kind of started the year at a spending level which was a little over 35% of revenue. And we came into 2017 saying that we would get that down to roughly 34%. Reflected in our guidance is it will be closer to 33%. So we're delivering well ahead of our expectations, which have been a function of the 2 things you highlighted: one, much stronger growth; and two, lower spending levels. And those lower spending levels from the first half of this year to the second half are a function of continuing to look at every dollar that we spend, whether it's R&D, whether it sales and marketing, or whether it's G&A and making sure that those dollars are allocated towards the biggest growth opportunities.",".

Question: Can you give us a little more color on the growth drivers?

Answer: So we had great growth in our data center business, which was driven by strong demand from the cloud and hyperscale customers. We also had good growth in our enterprise business, which was driven by strong demand from large customers like Amazon and Microsoft. And then we had good growth in our consumer business, which was driven by strong demand from smartphones and tablets."
Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And we're not to redeploy that capital or to get it out of the ecosystem. So our first half to second half spend levels will be down roughly $700 million on a business that will be roughly $2.5 billion bigger in the second half versus the first half. So we're making great progress and making real trade-offs on our spending levels and getting the benefit of stronger growth. And we expect the combination of those 2 to continue as we go forward.

In the meantime, I mean this is, in your words, your biggest server refresh in a decade, and we're not seeing any upside. We're doing 7% year-over-year pretty much for the full year, which I guess I would classify as barely high single digit. We're not really seeing meaningful ASP increases from mix as Purley. I was wondering if you could just kind of give us a view on, I guess, your expectations for data center, where it's coming in, why we're not seeing more upside from the Purley ramp versus what we've seen from prior platform introductions, and whether or not 7% actually would qualify as high single digits by your definition.

First, because you've kind of got a couple of questions in there, the way I would tell you is that the Purley ramp has just really started. It starts with the big comm service providers. You saw Google talk about it a couple of weeks ago. You saw Microsoft talk about it earlier this week. Those ramps are just beginning. I talked about the 200 design wins or design-ins at customers. Those are starting to come out. So we are really early. These ramps, remember because we have to   it will go through the cloud service providers and then the Tier 2 cloud service provider, then on into comms and eventually into enterprise as well.",".

The ramp's right within the range we predicted it to be from a ramp of that product. Your second part of your question is 7% high single digits. I will just make it simple and say, look, if you look, mathematically, I think it would meet a minima of high single digits, but it's certainly not necessarily where we're targeting to get to, but it's a high single-digit number. I'm not going to   the math doesn't lie.

                                                   Just to maybe add a little bit, I think the first part of your question, overall growth for the year relative to the expectations back in January, revenue will be up $2.5 billion.",".

What is the company's guidance for 2017 revenue?"
Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Obviously, PC is a significant part of that. Memory is growing faster. IoT is growing faster. PSG and data center   PSG faster in the second half versus the first half, and DCG in line with our full year outlook at the beginning of the year to be high single digits. So real good strength on clients, on memory, on IoT and in line with the other businesses. The other thing I would just offer to   follow up on Brian's commentary on DCG growth   maybe 2 things. One, we started out at 6% in Q1. We were at 9% in Q2. We're at 7% in Q3 off a real tough comp last year of double-digit growth in the third quarter.",".

Question: What is the company's outlook for DCG growth in the second half of the year?

Answer: The company expects DCG growth to be high single digits in the second half of the year."
Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So I would say from a top line perspective, we're right in line with kind of the guide that we gave at the end of the year. And secondly and as importantly, our operating margins has continued to grow significantly quarter-on-quarter through the course of the year, with 46% operating margins in the third quarter. And we told you early on despite a relatively slow start, we expect that operating margin for DCG to be above 40% for the year, and we're well on track to hit that important metric as well. So 9 months through the year, a great start to the year for us, and DCG in line with our expectations and building momentum as we exit the year.

                                                   I do. I want to ask about gross margins really quick. So revenue was up 0.6%. I guess, year-over-year, excluding McAfee. Gross margins are down like 90 bps year-over-year. I was wondering   I was hoping you could give us some color on the drivers of that shift.

So we feel pretty good about where we are. And for the dynamics underneath the covers, the trends have been very consistent, volume leverage with good scale going through the fabs. ASPs modestly better, much better in the first half on easier comps, slightly better in the second half on tougher comps. Unit costs continues to come down. The ramp costs associated with 10-nanometer are lower. And offsetting those, you really have 3 things going on. One, we have a high growth in our adjacent businesses, memory and modem, that weigh on   that are a big contributor to improved earnings, but they weigh on our gross margin.",".

So you take those all into account, and they have delivered solid Q3 dynamics, solid Q4 outlook. And the one change between Q3 and Q4 is primarily attributable to the mix of the higher growth adjacency businesses. Those trends and those dynamics, we'll talk much more about 2018 in January, but those trends have been fairly consistent for the last 4 quarters.

Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: From a unit standpoint, the decline has certainly slowed down, right? We   if you go back a year or 2 ago, we were high single digits to low teens declines at times year-over-year from a unit basis. And that slowed into the low single digits that we're seeing today, but we still are seeing a decline on a unit level. And I always remind people, we've taken probably something like 25% of the annual units out of this business, yet grown in that time frame the profitability of that business significantly. So that I think just talks about both the great execution in products and segmentation strategy and just the leadership that, that team, at first with Navin Shenoy and now with Greg Bryant, have really delivered to the company.",".

Question: Can you give us a little more color on the profitability of that business?

Answer: So, I think what you're seeing is that, as we've taken a lot of units out of this business, we've also seen a significant increase in profitability. And I think that speaks to the great execution in products and the segmentation strategy that we've implemented over the last few years."
Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So our view is, John, that if you take a long-term view, we see the pattern kind of stabilizing at about where it is. I think we'll come in here, and there'll be quarters when the units are up slightly, and there'll be quarters when the units are down a little more slightly. But when we looked at it over the long haul, they're probably going to be down, those low single digits. But we also see segments that are growing that are very performance-focused, which allow us opportunities. So you talked about gaming, 2-in-1 devices, thin and light, the Ultrabook, as we like to think about it from the old. Those products are continuing to see growth actually. And they are pushing that record Core i5, i7.",".

Question: What are the segments that are growing?

Answer: The segments that are growing are performance-focused, which allow us opportunities."
Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: They're pushing the desire for Core i9, which is a new product that we introduced, right? Those are what's driving the segmentation, the ASP uplift and the increased profitability. We think to some level, that trend will continue. How long, I   I'm not going to be that good of a prognosticator, but certainly for the near-term future, we don't see this trend shifting very much.

                                                   And then Brian, just on the modem side, in your prepared comments, I think you said it was up 37% year-over-year. What's the sustainability of that business and your ability to kind of continue to grow that business through penetration?                                         
Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [24]

What is the sustainability of the modem business?
Intel is excited about the modem business because it is generating increased profits. The modem business is growing, and Intel is able to sustain this growth through penetration."
Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We   we've I think really gotten a team together that is world-class. We believe we now are on a yearly cadence of world-class modems, which is really critical. That's a big hurdle to get that technology to where you can reliably put out a yearly cadence, a world-class modem. We believe we're there now. We continue to increase the profitability or the efficiency of that organization, which we've always talked about in the past, and that's continued. So we think we can continue to both drive the technology and continue to grow that business.

                                                   Our next question is from Romit Shah with Nomura.                                         
Romit Jitendra Shah,  Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - Executive Director    [26]
                                                   Great EPS growth.",".

What was the company's EPS growth for the quarter?"
Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: I   Bob, I think some of us who are more on the optimistic side definitely see a path to $4 of EPS, which makes look   makes Intel look compelling. I think some of the pushback, though, has been among value investors who look at free cash flow. In this year for example, even with the equity gains, it looks like free cash flow is tracking down. So I know that this is an investment year, but how should people be thinking about free cash flow growth relative to EPS growth next year and maybe even 2019 as well?                                         
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [27]
                                                   Yes, the   first in 2017, people ought to be thinking about free cash flow growth being $1.5 billion to $2 billion higher than what we   what was primarily reflected in our guidance.",".

Question: How much higher should free cash flow growth be than EPS growth next year and potentially even in 2019?
Answer: Free cash flow growth should be $1.5 billion to $2 billion higher than EPS growth next year and potentially even in 2019."
Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Because we're saying that our current forecast is   will be much better than kind of where we started the year. And that improvement is really a function of 3 things: one, earnings growth, more operating earnings growth as opposed to the ICAP gains, but real solid operating earnings growth; secondly, we reduced our CapEx outlook for the year from $12 billion to $11.5 billion this year; and third, we   the long-term agreements that we signed in the year. One of the benefits on what we're trying to do is really match our net capital deployed in memory in conjunction with demand from strategic clients and partners, which has the effect of reducing the impact of the memory capital intensity on the free cash flows of the business that makes sense for our customers and makes sense for us.",".

Question: What is the impact of the memory capital intensity on the free cash flows of the business?

Answer: The impact of the memory capital intensity on the free cash flows of the business is that it reduces the impact of the memory capital intensity on the free cash flows of the business."
Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So we'll continue to look for those opportunities. The biggest gap between our earnings performance and our free cash flow performance has been the higher capital associated with growth, number one, but in particular, memory. And we're really looking for opportunities to reduce our net capital deployed into memory, which in turn will grow free cash flow over time, just closer and closer to our EPS growth.                                         
Romit Jitendra Shah,  Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - Executive Director    [28]
                                                   And I guess along those lines, Brian, can you just give us an update on how you're thinking about CapEx at these levels and going forward?                                         
Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [29]
                                                   Sure.",".

Question: How are you thinking about CapEx at these levels and going forward?

Answer: We're looking for opportunities to reduce our net capital deployed into memory, which in turn will grow free cash flow over time, just closer and closer to our EPS growth."
Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: What   I think in our statements and in the release, we showed you that we actually lowered CapEx to   by about $500 million for this year. We've talked about CapEx and thinking about it kind of being in this range. I don't think we have anything else to say about it. It's pretty close. Right now, we're just focused on the execution into Q4 and prepping for our views into 2018. So I don't want to have any other discussion on CapEx until we get to the January time frame right now for 2018.

What is the ASP trend in DCG?
The ASP trend in DCG is up 2%."
Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So if we look at the 4 subsegments, cloud, comm service provider, enterprise, adjacencies, if you just look at those buckets as a silo as you ramp Skylake, did ASPs move higher in all of those subsegments? I'm just trying to get a sense for how broad-based the value capture was.

                                                   Yes, I would just, without giving you all the specifics of ASPs by segment, I would just say the biggest driver of ASP improvement is really incremental performance. So as we continue to transition   we're still transitioning Haswell to Broadwell, which all else equal, there is positive ASP implications as we transition to Xeon Scalable and deliver higher performance. That growing mix of higher performance products is the single biggest contributor to ASP.",".

Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We're still in the early days, as Brian mentioned in Xeon Scalable, but that is a higher performance product. And we would expect that will share in the benefits of high performance for our clients with higher ASPs, but that's the biggest dynamic.                                         
Harlan Sur,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [33]
                                                   Great. And the team has talked about accelerating the server road maps to be more closely aligned with the cadence of manufacturing technology migrations, I believe starting with the 10-nanometer nodes. Can you guys just give us an update there?

                                                   Yes, think of it, so first, absolutely, you're right that we are going to move much more of our focus towards data center products coming first.",".

Q: What is the cadence for 10-nanometer node product launches?
A: We'll launch them in phases."
Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: It's not going to be the early part of the 10-nanometer, though. It just   you got to look at the design cycles. And you make a decision like that, even you make it last year. You'll start to see the effect of the back end of 10-nanometers, and you'll really see it affect, 7-nanometers. So not these early products on 10, no. They were already in the hopper when we made that move.

Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: You talked about in the script and in some of the Q&A here, some changes to the co-marketing programs and the like going forward in both the PC and the data center business. Is there any way you could maybe bound for us the size of those and their contributions to what the run rate has been of overall OpEx, and what kind of opportunities there are potentially to further restructure those going forward?

                                                   Yes, just on the co-marketing program in particular, this is really what we're trying to do is retain the value of the Intel Inside brand, but also to be more flexible and to kind of align our spending in conjunction with our customers   more tailored programs by customer to drive more efficient demand.",".

On the co-marketing program specifically, we're trying to retain the value of the Intel Inside brand while also being more flexible and aligning our spending with our customers more tailored programs by customer to drive more efficient demand."
Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: That's the intent of what we're trying to accomplish. And we're pretty excited about the change. The quantification of that strategy, in essence in the third quarter, was roughly $200 million that, in essence, shifted from spending to contra revenue. So no impact on operating income dollars, but roughly $200 million lower revenue, $200 million lower spending. And we expect that to be modestly higher as we go into the fourth quarter. So again, more effective and efficient way to spend our marketing dollars in conjunction with tailoring programs for   with the OEMs. That drives a change in the geography of how those dollars were reflected in our P&L, but doesn't really impact our operating income.

Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And then as a follow-up, Brian, in automotive space, I think you mentioned 14 ADAS wins from Mobileye versus 12 of all last year. And that's sort of in the ADAS space, and you have some of your competitors making quite bold announcements about wins towards autonomous driving programs long term. Maybe you could talk about how commitments are being made in ADAS versus autonomous, and then how the acquisition that you've seen so far of Mobileye has maybe pulled some of your computing assets into these conversations for longer term with autonomous?                                         
Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [39]

And I'll tell you that's   there's a lot of just kind of experimental work going on there. If I take a look at though kind of a bigger picture, which is what you're asking is, this whole picture that we've been putting together is, I kind of said in the statement that, individually, these businesses are great. But when you pull these together into one package and you're able to walk into a customer with a complete solution, they're truly world-class and something nobody else can deliver.","

And they're   what we're seeing is different OEMs, different customers thinking about those architectures even differently across that spectrum. Some are thinking, ""Well, by Level 5, I think my skills will be up. I want a closed system. I want to have much more of the control of the software."" So we have a set of solutions we bring to them there. Some of them want to have more FPGAs for how they bring their software down onto the silicon earlier on. But what we're able to do is bring our modems.",".

What are the different types of autonomous driving architectures that Intel brings to customers?"
Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We shipped   and we mentioned it in the release that   our first automotive modem. So we're able to bring automotive modems all the way through 5G. Most of these car companies are having to build data centers. And not just data centers, centralized data centers, but really a data center kind of architecture that goes all the way out with data and compute at the edge. You're going to want to be able to manipulate and transfer mapping, high-precision mapping to the cars and data back from the cars to change those maps, construction and things like that. So we're building that architecture. And we have the products and the talent to uniquely work with them all through that infrastructure.",".

Question: What car companies are you working with?

Answer: We're working with most of the major car companies."
Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And then you get out to the car again and we can bring the FPGA, the Mobileye for center fusion or compute. We can put Xeons in there. And so we   in each one of these discussions, they're all a bit different. They all have multiple phases as you go to 3, 4 and 5 on the levels. And what we're able to do is say you don't just have to take this one solution. This is not the only solution there is. What would you like to do? What best solves your problem in the most cost-effective lower   lowest power efficient way? How much work do you want us to do in software development versus how much work do you want to own and have IP within your company? And that's changing, as we said, over time.",".

Amnon has really has driven a vision that says it's one thing to bring foils to a meeting. It's another thing to bring a car and say now let's go out and drive, and show you how all of these fit together. And so all of that is   this package that we have is unique, and it's resonating quite well as we walk into the various car OEMs. And I'm out there with them in various modes almost every week, every other week. Amnon's out. We're all talking about a complete package.

Thanks, Mark. Coming off a record 2017, 2018 is off to an exceptionally strong start. Q1 was Intel's best first quarter ever and significantly exceeded the expectations we set in January. Our Client Computing Group continue to execute well, producing growth within a declining PC market. And our transformation to a data-centric company accelerated with our data-centric businesses, booting McAfee up 25% over the first quarter of last year.",".

Question: What was the best first quarter ever for Intel?
Answer: The best first quarter ever for Intel was Q1 2018."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
The strength of Intel's business underscores my confidence in our strategy. What we're seeing is an unrelenting demand for compute performance driven by the continuing growth of data and the need to process, analyze, store and share that data. That dynamic benefits our traditional CPU business and it reinforces the big bets we've made in memory, modems, FPGAs and autonomous vehicles. We're competing to win in our largest collection of addressable markets ever. And importantly, we're not just competing in these markets. We're leading and shaping them as our first quarter results demonstrate. 
Data Center Group revenue was up 24% year-over-year. We saw broad-based demand strength across all DCG segments in Q1. And customer preference for high performance products, including Xeon Scalable drove a richer ASP mix. 
The cloud segment grew 45%.",".

What drove the 24% year-over-year growth in Data Center Group revenue?
The demand for compute performance, driven by the continuing growth of data and the need to process, analyze, store and share that data."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And in the comm service provider segment, we continue to take share and grew revenue 33% as customers chose IA-based solutions to virtualize and transform their networks as the industry prepares for the 5G transition. 
Intel's presence at the Winter Olympics in Pyongyang was a powerful showcase of our 5G capability. Intel and KT deployed the world's largest 5G network to date, including more than 20 5G links delivering 3,800 terabytes of network capacity. We've established leadership in 5G. And when commercial networks begin deploying around 2019, we'll be there with industry-leading products from the core of the data center to the edge to mobile devices. 
And we also saw growth in our enterprise segments for the second consecutive quarter as macro strength continued and customers prioritized hybrid and on-premises infrastructure investments.",".

What is the size of Intel's 5G network?

Intel's 5G network is the world's largest to date."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Data center customers are also looking to FPGAs for workload acceleration. The Programmable Solutions Group again set a record for design win volume, and those design wins are translating directly into revenue. 
PSG's business grew 17% in Q1 on data center and embedded strength along with last time buys. PSG's data center segment was up 150% over last year, and the Advanced products category, our 28-, 20- and 14-nanometer solutions grew more than 40%. 
Microsoft also recently announced that they're using Intel's FPGAs to power new Bing intelligent search features using real-time AI. PSG's momentum is evidence that our 2016 acquisition of Altera is delivering value for our customers and contributing directly to Intel's growth. 
Our IoTG business grew 17% on record unit volume with continuing momentum in the retail and video segment as compute increasingly moves to the edge.",".

What is the Programmable Solutions Group's record for design win volume?
What is the Programmable Solutions Group's business growth in Q1 2018?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Consistent with our commitment to be disciplined with our resources, we made the decision to divest Wind River and sharpen the focus of IoTG on other growth opportunities that more closely align to our strategy. 
The memory business set a revenue record, growing 20% in the first quarter, crossing over the $1 billion mark in revenue. The last business that passed that mark was DCG, crossing over that mark over a decade ago. 
Both yields and output in our Dalian factory continue to ramp ahead of schedule. In fact, we believe the Dalian Fab extension is one of the fastest brownfield of wafer starts projects in memory industry history. 
We also launched our first mainstream Optane SSDs for clients, known as the 800 series, driving further industry adoption of this revolutionary technology.",".

What was the decision to divest Wind River?
The decision to divest Wind River was made in order to sharpen the focus of IoTG on other growth opportunities that more closely align to Intel's strategy."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: The NSG remains on track to be profitable for the full year. 
And we continue to demonstrate momentum in autonomous driving, and I'm happy to report that the Intel Mobileye autonomous vehicle test fleet has begun to operate in Israel and will expand to other geographies in the coming months. Our fleet fully implements the Responsible Sensitive Safety system or RSS that we introduced last year. This unique system applies a formal, common sense safety field to the vehicle's decision making, resulting in the optimal combination of provable safety and humanlike driving style. We believe that the winning path to autonomous driving will be a progression from ADAS capabilities to full autonomous driving. And we're seeing significant momentum in the marketplace, including a recent high-volume design win for EyeQ5 with a European premium vehicle manufacturer.",".

And finally, the Client Computing Group extended its strong track record of execution in a challenging PC environment. The revenue was up 3% despite a declining PC TAM on strength in the commercial and enthusiast segments, leading to a strong core mix. The CCG launched its first ever i9 processors for laptops in the first quarter, again demonstrating our outright product leadership. 
We continue to make progress on our 10-nanometer process. We are shipping in low volume and yields are improving, so the rate of improvement is slower than we anticipated. As a result, volume production is moving from the second half of 2018 into 2019. We understand the yield issues and have defined improvements for them, but they will take time to implement and qualify.",".

Q: What was the Client Computing Group's revenue in the first quarter?

Moore's Law is essential to our strategy and our product leadership. It continues to create significant value for Intel and our customers. While it's taking longer and costing more to deliver and yield advanced process technologies, we are able to optimize our process and products within a node to deliver meaningful performance improvements. For example, 14-nanometer process optimizations and architectural improvements have resulted in performance gains of more than 70% since the first 14-nanometer products were launched. We combined these advances in manufacturing technology and architecture that produced truly a leadership product, and it's that product leadership that ultimately matters most to our customers and end users.",".

What is the name of the product that Intel is leading with?

The name of the product that Intel is leading with is ""Whiskey Lake."""

Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [4]
                                        
Thanks, Brian. Q1 was truly an outstanding start to 2018. Our transformation to a data-centric company continues to build momentum. Revenue was a first quarter record of $16.1 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Operating income was $4.8 billion, up 21% year-over-year. And EPS of $0.87 was up 32% year-over-year. 
From a capital allocation perspective, we generated $6.3 billion of cash flow from operations and returned $3.3 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividend.",".

Question: What is the company's strategy for artificial intelligence and the autonomous revolution?
Answer: Intel is positioning itself as the end-to-end platform provider for the new data world and the leader in artificial intelligence and the autonomous revolution."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: As a result of the strength we are seeing in the business, we are raising our full year revenue guide by $2.5 billion to $67.5 billion. We're raising our EPS guide by $0.30 to $3.85. And we're raising our free cash flow guide by $1.5 billion to $14.5 billion. 
Our Q1 results demonstrated continued momentum in our transformation from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company. Intel's data-centric businesses were up 25% collectively with each business individually growing double digits. Our data-centric businesses are now approaching 50% of our revenue, an all-time high. 
Our PC-centric business was up 3% on strength in notebook, desktop and modem. DCG strong cash flows fund Intel's investment in new data-centric growth. 
As a reminder, we adopted a new revenue recognition standard in Q1. The new standard drove $462 million in incremental Q1 revenue recognition.",".

What is the new revenue recognition standard?
The new revenue recognition standard is the new standard that drove $462 million in incremental Q1 revenue recognition."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: This predominantly affected CCG and NSG. By year-end, we expect roughly half of this to net out. 
Moving to Q1 earnings. We generated significant EPS expansion in the quarter, up 32% year-on-year. Our non-GAAP EPS improvement was driven by strong top line growth, a 3-point improvement in operating margins and an 11-point reduction in our effective tax rate. The 3-point improvement in operating margins were driven by a 4-point reduction in spending, partially offset by a 1 point decline in gross margin. The 1 point decline in gross margin was driven by growth in our adjacencies, which have lower gross margins than our CPU products. 
From a spending standpoint, versus last year, we delivered $1.3 billion more revenue on $200 million less spending. 
As a second reminder, we adopted a new mark-to-market standard for our equity investments.",".

What was the main driver of EPS expansion in Q1 2018? 
The main driver of EPS expansion in Q1 2018 was strong top line growth, a 3-point improvement in operating margins and an 11-point reduction in our effective tax rate."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: In 2017, all realized gains and losses were recorded in our non-GAAP results. But in 2018, all mark-to-market adjustments flow through earnings. In an effort to eliminate volatility, we have excluded these adjustments from our non-GAAP results. Our Q1 GAAP EPS included approximately $0.13 for mark-to-market gains in our ICAP portfolio that were excluded from our non-GAAP results. 
We are also making excellent progress in our operating efficiencies. In January, we pulled in our 30% spending goal from 2020 to 2019, and we're off to a good start in 2018. Total spending was down 4% year-over-year in the quarter. R&D spending as a percentage of revenue was down approximately 2 points. And our SG&A costs were down over 2 points. Our intensity on spending is designed to accelerate top line growth, and it is paying off.",".

Question: What is the reason for excluding mark-to-market gains from non-GAAP results?
Answer: The reason for excluding mark-to-market gains from non-GAAP results is to eliminate volatility."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Currently, as a result of strong top line growth, we now expect to meet our 30% spending target in 2018, 2 years ahead of our original expectations. 
Let me touch briefly on our Q1 performance by segment. The Data Center Group delivered a great quarter, much better than expected. DCG revenue of $5.2 billion was up 24% year-over-year, and operating income of $2.6 billion grew 75%. Q1 operating margin was 50%. Overall, unit volume was up 16%, and ASPs were up 7%. 
We saw broad-based demand strength in Q1 with customer preference for high-performance products driving richer ASPs. Cloud and comms service providers segments were greater than 60% of the data center business. And this was the first quarter our cloud business has surpassed $2 billion in revenue, which made it our largest segment in the first quarter.",".

Question: What was the main driver of growth in the Data Center Group in Q1?
Answer: The Data Center Group's growth was driven by strong demand for high-performance products."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
Additionally, we redefined our expanded TAM for DCG to markets beyond the CPU, like silicon photonics, Fabric, network ASICs and 3D XPoint memory. These adjacent businesses are gaining traction and grew 16% year-over-year. DCG performance in all segments was better than our January forecast, and we expect that strength to continue to aid DCG momentum through the second quarter. 
Our additional data-centric businesses, IoTG, NSG and PSG, are becoming a larger component of our overall business, growing 18% year-over-year in the quarter. Our Internet of Things business achieved revenue of $840 million, growing 17% year-over-year, driven by strength in video and continued momentum in retail. Operating profit was $227 million, up 116% year-over-year on higher revenue and lower spending as we shifted our ADAS investments to Mobileye. 
As you heard from Brian, the Mobileye business is going strong.",".

What is the expanded TAM for DCG?
The expanded TAM for DCG is markets beyond the CPU, like silicon photonics, Fabric, network ASICs and 3D XPoint memory."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Q1 revenue was $151 million. And while it's early in the journey, we are on track to our deal thesis. 
Our memory business broke the $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, up 20% year-over-year with strong demand for data center SSD solutions. 
We reduced our operating losses by $48 million with strong gigabyte demand and unit cost reductions more than offsetting ASP reductions. 
The transition to 64 3D NAND is improving our cost while we invest in and expand our Dalian factory. We expect the second half of '18 to be balanced between supply and demand, and we continue to expect this segment to be profitable for the full year of 2018. 
The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $498 million with 17% growth, driven by strength in data center and the embedded segments.",".

What is the Programmable Solutions Group's growth rate? 17%"
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Operating profit was $97 million, up 5% year-over-year. The PSG team continues to perform and execute well. Our advanced FPGA products, those at 28-, 20- and 14-nanometer, grew over 40% in the quarter. In fact, PSG won more customer designs in Q1 than in any prior quarter. 
Finally, the Client Computing Group had another strong quarter. Revenues of $8.2 billion were up 3%, and operating margins were down 4 points due to 10-nanometer transition cost and growth in our modem business. 
Our PC-centric business continues to perform well in a challenging but improving market and serves as a significant source of cash flow for the company. We saw strength in the commercial and gaming businesses, and we believe the worldwide PC supply chain is operating at healthy levels.",".

What was the growth in PSG products?
The growth in PSG products was over 40%."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
We've laid out our capital allocation priorities: invest organically, expand acquisitively and return capital to our shareholders, and do it wisely. We continue to execute to these priorities. We generated $6.3 billion in cash from operations. This included $1.7 billion in cash received from NAND customer supply agreement. We invested $2.9 billion in CapEx and delivered $3.4 billion in free cash flow, up 73% year-over-year. We returned almost 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of $1.9 billion in buybacks and $1.4 billion in dividends, a 10% increase per share over last year. 
Now moving to our full year outlook. Our strategy is working, and our investments are paying off. We are now forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $67.5 billion, up $2.5 billion versus our expectations in January.",".

Question: What is Intel's outlook for the rest of the year?
Answer: Intel is forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $67.5 billion, up $2.5 billion versus their expectations in January."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We expect operating margin of approximately 31%, up 1 point from January as spending as a percent of revenue drops to approximately 30%. 
Versus prior estimates, gross margin will be approximately flat as broad-based strength in our business is offset by the higher cost associated with the 10-nanometer volume production shift to 2019. 
We now expect a full year tax rate of 13%, 1 point down versus our prior estimate. Overall, stronger top line growth, improved operating margins and a lower tax rate will boost EPS to $3.85, up $0.30 versus prior estimate. From a cash flow perspective, we are increasing our free cash flow to $14.5 billion, up $1.5 billion from January. We now expect net capital deployed of approximately $12.5 billion, up $500 million versus the expectations we set in January.",".

Question: What is the company's expectation for its operating margin?
Answer: The company expects its operating margin to be approximately 31%."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: This reflects gross CapEx of approximately $14.5 billion offset by approximately $2 billion of customer prepayments for memory supply agreement. 
In Q2, we expect strong growth to continue. We are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $16.3 billion, up 10% year-over-year. We expect operating margin of approximately 30%, up 1 point versus last year, which reflects approximately 1.5 point decrease in gross margin and a 2.5 to 3-point decline in spending. 
We expect EPS of $0.85, up 31% excluding equity adjustments from strong top line growth, spending reductions and a lower tax rate. 
To sum it up, we believe 2018 will be another record year for Intel. We've met and exceeded our financial commitments, and we feel great about where we are relative to our 3-year plan.",".

Ross Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [2]
                                        
Brian, one for you about the sustainability of this demand, specifically in the data center side.",".

Ross, what would you like to know?

Intel has been reporting good results for the past few quarters. What do you think is driving this demand?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: I think people are pretty aware that the macroeconomic drivers are all kind of going the right way and that's helping the enterprise side of things. But the acceleration of the cloud and the comm side for the last 2 quarters is beating your own expectations for growth rates and been quite strong. How much of that do believe is Intel specific? And if you can go to the reasons why? Or is the macro side really the bigger driver in those 2 vectors as well?                                         
Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]
                                        
Sure, Ross. That's a good question. Let me try and answer it.",".

1. How much of the acceleration of cloud and comm growth rates do you believe is specific to Intel? 
2. What are some reasons for the acceleration of these growth rates?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So first thing I'll tell you is that there is a bit here that is the transition to cloud continues to occur, occurring at a bit even faster rate so that   you do see that trend is going on. But remember, we've always talked about that over the long haul, you have to look at these, it can sometimes be lumpy. So our forecast for the long term is still in that high teens, low 20s kind of range for that kind of growth. We thought that we   the enterprise is clearly up. We think that   as you said that a lot of that is reinvigoration of investments by companies in on-site data.","

Q: What is the long-term forecast for cloud growth?
A: The long-term forecast for cloud growth is still in that high teens, low 20s kind of range."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Our view of long term there, I look out over the long term again, it's still   that should be in a declining mode versus moving those workloads long term over to the cloud. So if I take a look at this, as Bob said in his prepared remarks, so we look at   if I look at our data-centric businesses in general, so even just beyond the data center, we see these growing in that mid- to high teens range. And that's kind of how we view this. And we do believe that is sustainable. And it will move from cloud to enterprise. And sometimes, you'll see IoT pick up a bit, offset something, but that's why we grouped those into that data centric. But they're all really tied together.","

What is Intel's view of the long term for its data-centric businesses?

Intel believes that its data-centric businesses will continue to grow in the mid- to high teens range, and that this growth will move from the cloud to enterprise."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: It's data coming from the edge, moving through the network into the data center and really being based in the cloud and analytics being applied to it and people using that data then to make decisions to drive businesses.

The only thing, Ross, that I would add is in terms of our outlook in the more near term, our outlook for the year is kind of continued strength in the second quarter similar to the first quarter. And   but beyond that, it's probably a little cloudier. I think we are benefiting from global macroeconomic environment.",".

Question: What is your outlook for the year?

Answer: Our outlook for the year is continued strength in the second quarter similar to the first quarter."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: I think the higher earning is   higher earnings and the ability to deduct IT related expenditures, I think is giving CIOs a little more money to spend. And we see ourselves benefiting from that through the first half of the year. 
Second half is going to be a little bit of a wait and see as to whether the short-term dynamics continue into the second half. But you go back to Brian's comments, I think the   what we do know is the   this increased demand for compute data, analytics, storage, rapid retrieval is what's really driving the demand for high performance compute. And not only do we see the unit volume strength but also the ASP strength, which we think is a function of Intel-related products.

A, we understand the yield issues. They're really tied to this being the last technology tied to not having EUV and the amount of multi-patterning and the effects of that or defects. But also, the real strengths of 14-nanometers, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we've done 70% improvements in the performance of that technology over its current life time.

I wanted to follow-up on that 10-nanometer point. So as the volume production pushes out into 2019, given you understand the yield issue supposedly, is this a first half kind of push out? Or does it push out into the second half? And when it actually does ramp, do you think it actually will be the current 10-nanometer process that's shipping?

It's really about that. They aren't necessarily around performance. We do have plans on 10-nanometer all ready similar to 14-nanometer, for 10-plus and 10++.

Secondly, we brought on 10-nanometer equipment but haven't necessarily put it to use yet. So that's a cash driver without an impact on earnings. And third, memory is in the investment phase.

Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So the issues around 10 nanometers, I kind of tried to lay that out without getting too deep into the technology, but this is the last technology with   that doesn't incorporate EUV. And what you also need to understand is that we took very aggressive goals at 10 nanometers. So if you talk about the scaling factor or think about it as the multiple at which you shrink a feature, okay, we took a target of 2.7. So you took any feature and 1 over 2.7 is the dimensional shrink that you get to this device. For example, on 14 nanometers, we took a target of 2.4. So you're almost 10% more aggressive on 10 nanometers.",".

Answer: The scaling factor for 10 nanometers is 2.7."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And if you look at what more is the industry standard, what the foundries and other players are typically doing, they're typically in that 1.5 to 2.0 range. So they're   we're maybe 20% more aggressive. So we took very aggressive goals to hit our cost targets and where we want the technology to be. And that, combined with end-of-life of emergent scanner before we hit EUV, has just created something that's a little bit more difficult. And so that's why I have the confidence that this is not something we're shipping, that transistors work. We know the performance is in line. So it's really just about getting the defects and the cost in line to where we want. As far as what does that imply for future technologies, we made a lot of changes at 7 nanometers.",".

Question: What does that imply for future technologies?

Answer: That it will be more difficult to achieve the same levels of performance at 7 nanometers."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 7 nanometers currently is the first technology forecasted to implement EUV. So that immediately makes the lithography system different. We're going back to a more standard for us compaction number of 2.4 So that makes it a little bit easy. We think we've bit off a little too much in this case. And it may not seem like a lot, but 10% can make a lot of difference in this kind of the world. And thirdly, we are using some very unique packaging technologies and such that allow us that 7 nanometers and beyond, we really move into a world where you're not going to look at any piece of silicon as being a single node. You're going to use what we're going to call heterogeneous techniques that allow us to use silicon for multiple nodes.",".

Question: What is the difference between 7 nanometers and 10 nanometers?

Answer: The difference between 7 nanometers and 10 nanometers is that 7 nanometers is the first technology forecasted to implement EUV."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So you may use course from 7 nanometers and IP from 14 nanometers and even as far back as 22 nanometers for the parts that don't need the high performance.

So really, 7 nanometers is quite a bit different, and so I think as a result, we don't expect to see these kinds of impacts on 7 nanometers.

Yes, the   just the CapEx that we took up, $0.5 billion is really a function of the incremental $2.5 billion of revenue. So of course, when we came into the year, we guided a logic CapEx of roughly $10.5 billion, and we had full year revenue of $65 billion. So we've taken $65 billion up to 67 50. That's going to require roughly $0.5 billion additional CapEx for the second half of the year and as we go into 2019.

Continued gigabyte demand, continuing to scale the Dalian fab and continuing to come down the gigabyte   the cost per gigabyte curve are all contributing to what we believe will be a continued growth and profitability for the business for the full year.

What is the company's goal for the Dalian fab?

The company's goal is to continue to grow and profitability for the business for the full year."

And maybe the only thing I'd add to that is as Bob mentioned in his remarks, our 64 Tier product, we   I still believe gives us really a leading-edge product and also a very good cost relative to the market. So as we ramp that technology in Dalian at 64 Tiers, we believe our costs are very competitive relative to the rest of the market.

The next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with CrÃ©dit Suisse.                                         
John William Pitzer,  CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [25]
                                        
Brian, I think within DCG, the cloud hyperscale dynamics are kind of well understood by investors."," that we might not be aware of.                                    

John Pitzer: So I'm just wondering, given that hyperscale dynamics are well understood by investors, what's your view on the competitive landscape in this space? And secondly, can you give us a sense of how much of the growth in the cloud is coming from hyperscale customers versus enterprise customers? 
Brian Krzanich: So I think the competitive landscape in the cloud is really interesting. I mean, I think there are a lot of players in the market. I think, obviously, Amazon is a big player. I think Google is a big player. I think Microsoft is a big player. I think Alibaba is a big player. I think there are a lot of players in the market. And I think the thing that's really interesting about the cloud is that it's really democratized. You can use it for any kind of application. So I think that's really appealing to a lot of customers. And then I think the other thing that's really interesting about the cloud is that it's really elastic. So if you have a lot of data, you can put it in the cloud. If you don't have a lot of data, you can put it in the cloud. So I think that's really appealing to a lot of customers. And then I think the last thing I'll say is that I think the cloud is really going to continue to grow. I think it's going to be a really big part of the future."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 90 days ago, I think what surprised everybody, probably including yourselves, was just the strength of enterprise in the December quarter. And I think when you reported December, you were reluctant to call that a trend and you wanted to get some more data points. I'm kind of curious as to kind of what the view of enterprise is now 90 days later. And specifically, a couple of your key software partners last year in Microsoft and VMware finally brought out kind of their hybrid cloud software stack solution, and I'm wondering if that's actually been the driver of some of this pent-up demand in the enterprise. And how sustainable do you think it is?                                         
Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [26]
                                        
Yes, it's a great question, John.",".

What is the view of enterprise now 90 days later?
The view of enterprise has increased demand for Intel's products."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: What I would tell you is clearly, as we look out into Q2, we're expecting the same kind of positive trend on enterprise for the second quarter. I think as we look at the long term though, that trend that enterprise should decline in that low single digit and it drives and helps fuel the growth of cloud, not all of those are drivers of the growth of cloud, that   those workloads are moving over to the cloud base continues. I think you're right. Products like Microsoft Azure and others where you can be a hybrid, Azure on-prem versus Azure on cloud, are great examples how, I think, that low single digits is sustainable over the long haul. But I just don't see that trend.","

What is Intel's long-term outlook for enterprise?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Again, I try and look at these businesses not over the quarter or even 1 to 2 quarters, but really thinking about how am I going to invest over the next 2 to 5 years. I got to look at that and say that trend's probably likely to continue. Now for us, you also need to understand that those other segments, so data center, the cloud and like networking and comms, as I look at the Data Center Group are now well over 50% of the revenue of that segment. So we are less and less impacted, I'd say, by the enterprise. If you go back when I started as CEO, enterprise was 60%, 70% of the business. And so we swung wildly by that.",".

Question: What percentage of Intel's revenue comes from the Data Center Group?

Answer: The Data Center Group is now well over 50% of the revenue of that segment."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: It's kind of the other way around now where the cloud and networking and storage are now that 60% to 70% growing to their right and the enterprise is less and less. So the other thing you need to realize, John, is we're more driven by what that cloud is doing anyway.                                         
John William Pitzer,  CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [27]
                                        
That's helpful. And as my follow up to Bob, just kind of a multipart question on the guide for Q2 and the full year.",".

What is Intel's guidance for Q2 and the full year?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: First, was the 606 impact embedded in the original March quarter guidance? Is that the only quarter where you'll have a 606 impact? Second, is Wind River now out of the Q2 and full year guide, or is that still in it? And kind of how big is that business? And then third, when you look at Q2 specifically, it just looks like the operating income beat seems a lot larger than the EPS beat. Is there anything going on below the line other than the tax rates that you guided to that can explain that?                                         
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [28]
                                        
Yes, great question. First, 606, what we expect for the full year, we had a strong benefit in the first quarter and roughly half of that unwinds during the course of the year.",".

Wind River is now out of the full year guidance. It's still in it. It's about $1.5 billion.

The operating income beat seems a lot larger than the EPS beat. There are a number of factors that contribute to that, but primarily it's due to strong product execution and growth in our data center business."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So it contribute to growth in Q1. It will unwind itself throughout the course of the year. So full year impact will be likely   at this stage of the game, we get more around $200 million to $250 million, but it unwinds through the next several quarters. I think your second question, John, was Wind River. Our assumptions are that we will complete the sale of that business at the end of the second quarter. So it's in our second quarter guide, but it's a component of the first half to second half deceleration. The third question, I think it relates to in the first quarter we had good volume, operating margin flow-through to EPS. In the second quarter, the flow-through is not as rich.",".

Question: What is the impact of the Wind River sale on Intel's second quarter earnings?

Answer: The impact of the Wind River sale on Intel's second quarter earnings is that it will reduce Intel's operating margin and EPS."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And the fundamental reason is we have some below-the-line charges associated with, a, the 2039 convertible securities that we have outstanding that have a exchange feature associated with them. And as people, as we hit a certain stock price, our holders can exercise that exchange feature. The implications are there's a noncash charge associated with that, which goes through our interest and other line that's negative. The good aspects of it is all else equal, it reduces our outstanding, our diluted shares and we avoid a coupon going forward. But that will have   as more people exercise that exchange feature, we'll see that noncash charge below the line. So that's causing a little bit of a drag on the operating income growth flowing through to the EPS in Q2.",".

Question: What is the exchange feature?

Answer: The exchange feature is when the holders of the convertible securities can exercise their rights to exchange them for shares of Intel Corp. with a value that is based on the stock price at the time of the exchange."

And our next question will come from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.                                         
Timothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [30]
                                        
I actually have a 2-part question on 10-nano. The issues seem to be going on now for some time, and it's almost as if the design libraries or something are flawed. And so I guess the first question is why not skip 10-nanometer and go directly to 7? You guys have a lot of EUV experience and it's going to cut out a lot of the multi-patterning layers. So that's the first question. And number two, the real question is that if you did that, would that be a net drag to gross margin looking out because you never really monetized 10-nanometer?                                         
Brian M.",".

1. Why did Intel decide to move from 10-nanometer to 7-nanometer?
2. If Intel moved to 7-nanometer, would that be a net drag to gross margin looking out because you never really monetized 10-nanometer?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [31]
                                        
Okay. So let me try and answer your question. So no, there's nothing wrong with the design libraries or anything like that. I mean, the proof of that is that we're shipping products. So if there were basic functionality issues like that, you wouldn't be able to produce and ship a product. Again, as I said, this is all around how many layers are on multi-patterning and kind of the end-of-life of the emergent for the critical later. The second part of your question was would it benefit to just skip to 7 nanometers and would that have an effect on the capital or the gross margin. The simple answer is no, I don't think that's a good idea.",".

No, I don't think that's a good idea."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: The best answer is to fix   there's a lot of learning that will happen that we can carry forward in the 7 nanometers, just like we carried from 14 to 10. The other thing is that we still hold roughly 80% of our capital equipment is fungible to the next node or backwards to the prior node. And so that's why as we shifted 10 and 14, we're able to do that without shifting our capital expenditures greatly. We're able to just move the capacity back and forth. The same thing is going to happen between 10 and 7. So you'll have some percentage, and it's always based on demand and how fast things are ramping and all of that. But the equipment will be fungible for the most part between 10 and 7 as well.","

What is Intel Corp's strategy for capital expenditures between 10 and 7 nanometers?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: But no, the right thing to do is exactly what we're doing. This is a unique opportunity we have. There's a lot, lot more performance in 14. We can keep driving that. We'll fix the yield issues. If 10, it's going to have a 10, a 10-plus, a 10++, you can see a lot of products and a lot of performance out of that technology.

And the next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet.                                         
Romit Jitendra Shah,  Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - Executive Director    [33]
                                        
Brian, I wanted to ask you about China. Your filings indicate that Mainland China was about 20-plus percent of revenue in 2017, and I have 2 questions.",".                                    

What is your outlook for Mainland China revenue in 2018 and beyond?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: One, does that figure represent your exposure to the domestic vendors in China? And I guess just in light of the current environment between the U.S. and China, there's reports now of potential ban beyond ZTE. How concerned are you as it relates to the impact to Intel?                                         
Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [34]
                                        
So yes, that number is much broader. So that would be   if you think about it, so everything from shipments in companies like ZTE or Huawei that are more domestically oriented, although Huawei ships around the world now, it goes to Lenovo and companies like that, spread charm, all of those companies now, if you look at Chinese companies, very few are holdings within just China. They're almost all shipping products and selling across the world.",".

Q2. How concerned are you about the potential impact of a U.S.-China trade war on Intel's business?

We're not overly concerned, but we're monitoring it closely."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So that's   that number is really representative of all of the companies that are building within China. Our view is that China is an important market as you just described, right, 20-something-plus percent. It's one of our fastest-growing segments as well. It's important to us, and we're counting on our leaders and the leaders of the world to go resolve these issues. We believe in fair trade. We believe that countries and companies need to be able to play in markets fairly and compete, and we're counting on this getting worked out. That's very important to us.                                         
Romit Jitendra Shah,  Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - Executive Director    [35]
                                        
Okay. Great. And then Bob, I'm curious if you'll shed more light on longer-term spending targets.",".

What is Intel's long-term spending target?

Intel's long-term spending target is to grow its revenue by 20% each year."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: But as we build our models for '19, do you think it's reasonable to assume that you can drive additional operating leverage beyond 2018?                                         
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [36]
                                        
You're right. I will shed more light on that later. No, but I think, look, the trends that you've seen over the last couple of years is in   it's kind of how we frame things back at our Analyst Day early last year, I guess. And that is that we're going to see an expanded TAM and with that expanded TAM, accelerating growth in areas that have lower gross margins. And that we expect over time that there will be a modest degradation in gross margins as a result of growing earnings in different segments.",".

Question: What is the expected degradation in gross margins as a result of growing earnings in different segments? 
Answer: We expect a modest degradation in gross margins as a result of growing earnings in different segments."
Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Intel Corp Earnings Call: But at the same time, we've said that, that gross margin modest erosion, we believe, will be offset by continued   both continuing to invest in the critical priorities, but getting leverage on our existing spending base. So with that, I think you're going to have a natural offset, and we're 2 years ahead of our targets to get to 30%. We're excited about the accelerating growth of the company, and we do believe that as we continue to accelerate growth and invest in key priorities that our leverage on spending continue to come down.

Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: DCG delivered its most profitable year since 2011 by focusing on premium and growth segments with industry-leading products. This business generated the cash to fund Intel's investments in new data center growth.
Moving to Q4 earnings. We generated significant EPS expansion in the quarter, up 37% year-on-year. Our EPS improvement was driven by strong top line growth, a 5-point improvement in operating margins and significant gains from our ICAP Portfolio.
Our gross margins expanded 2 points in the quarter, and our spending as a percent of revenue declined by 3 points as we delivered $700 million more revenue and $300 million less spending.
In terms of operating efficiency, we're well ahead of schedule of meeting our commitment by reducing spending to 30% by 2020. We now expect to achieve this goal no later than 2019.",".

What was the main driver of EPS growth in Q4?
The main driver of EPS growth in Q4 was strong top line growth, which was 5 points better than in Q3. This was due to increased demand for our premium and growth segments' products, as well as from our ICAP Portfolio."

Let me touch briefly on our segment performance. Client Computing Group had another strong quarter. Revenue of $9 billion was down 2 points and operating margins were down 2 points. Operating margins were lower on 10-nanometer transition costs.",".

Question: What was the main reason for the revenue decline in the Client Computing Group?
Answer: The main reason for the revenue decline in the Client Computing Group was lower demand for personal computers."
Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We saw strength in the commercial gaming business, and we believe the worldwide PC supply chain is operating at healthy levels.
The Data Center Group had record revenue of $5.6 billion, up 20% year-over-year, and operating income of $3 billion grew 59%. Q4 operating margin was 54%. As Brian mentioned earlier, we had strong growth in execution across all segments. Overall unit volume was up 10%, ASPs were up 8%, and our adjacencies grew by 35%. Our ASP strength demonstrates the value customers see in our high-performance products. Xeon Scalable launched in July, is ramping well, with customers broadly deploying its leadership product family. Revenue scale from leadership products, ASP strength and the exclusion of 2016 onetime charges drove strong operating income growth for the business.",".

Second, we funded a majority of the Mobileye acquisition from the sale of noncore assets during the year, including McAfee and the sale of ASML shares. And third, we redeemed $1.6 billion in convertible debt, reducing 59 million shares, and we also tendered higher-coupon debt for lower-coupon debt. 
Let me expand on the ICAP- and treasury-related transactions we executed in the quarter. First, we sold 11.4 million shares of our ASML holding, which generated $2 billion in cash proceeds and a gain of $1.5 billion. 
Second, we redeemed our 2035 convertible debenture. This redemption created a $2.8 billion cash outflow and a noncash loss of $385 million, which was tax-deductible.",".

Question: What was the gain from the sale of ASML shares?
Answer: The gain from the sale of ASML shares was $1.5 billion."
Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Since this debenture was convertible and therefore dilutive, the redemption effectively acted as a buyback that will reduce diluted share count by 59 million shares. 
And third, we successfully tendered $2.3 billion of high-coupon debt in the quarter. We exchanged $1.9 billion of old debt into $2 billion of 30-year new debt, reducing our coupon rate by 1%. We also redeemed $425 million of old debt for cash. This transaction both lowered our leverage and our interest expense. 
Adding it all up, 2017 was another record year for Intel. Revenue of $62.8 billion was up 9% year-over-year, driven by 16% growth in our data-centric businesses and 3% growth in PC-centric business. Operating income of $19.6 billion was up 18% on strong execution across the businesses and disciplined spending.",".

Question: What was the redemption effectively act as?
Answer: The redemption effectively acted as a buyback that will reduce diluted share count by 59 million shares."

Earnings per share of $3.46 was up 28% on excellent operational performance and the benefit of $0.35 from ICAP net gains. With the change to the accounting rules for recognizing price changes on equity investments, we do not expect to see these ICAP gains repeat. 
Before I turn to guidance, let me provide a little more context on the impact of tax reform on our business. Intel's fourth quarter results reflect a higher GAAP income tax expense of $5.4 billion as a result of U.S. corporate tax reform enacted in December. This includes a onetime required tax adjustment on previously untaxed foreign earnings, payable over 8 years, which was partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred income taxes for the new U.S. statutory tax rate.",".

Question: What is the impact of U.S. corporate tax reform on Intel's fourth quarter results?
Answer: The higher GAAP income tax expense of $5.4 billion reflects a onetime required tax adjustment on previously untaxed foreign earnings, payable over 8 years."
Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Looking ahead, we expect the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will help level the playing field for U.S. manufacturers like Intel that compete in today's global economy. We expect a 2018 tax rate of approximately 14%, driven by a lower U.S. statutory tax rate of 21%, lower tax on foreign income, benefits from U.S. exporters and the continuation of the R&D credit. The change in our tax rate drives approximately $0.28 in 2018 EPS. 
Intel has a rich history of investing in U.S.-led research and development and U.S. manufacturing. Just last year, we committed to the fit-up of our Fab 42 facility, creating thousands of jobs at completion. These tax reforms provide further incentive to continue investments like this.",".

What is the expected tax rate for Intel in 2018?
The expected tax rate for Intel in 2018 is approximately 14%."
Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: 
Before we turn to our 2018 outlook, I also want to highlight 2 accounting rule changes: first, new accounting rules for revenue recognition; and second, accounting for equity gains and losses. We do not expect a material impact to revenue from the revenue recognition accounting change. The changes in accounting for equity gains and losses will require the recognition of unrealized price changes each quarter, so equity holdings like our ASML position will see mark-to-market adjustments that will flow through earnings in 2018, which may create greater volatility on a GAAP basis. This change resulted in an impact of $2.7 billion of net unrealized gains at year-end that we booked to equity on January 1, 2018.
Now moving to the full year. We are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $65 billion, up 4% year-over-year.",".

What accounting rule change is Intel referring to?
The new accounting rule for revenue recognition."

The decline in gross margin is driven by growth in our adjacent businesses as we play in an expanded TAM and transition cost associated with 10-nanometer, both partially offset by higher gross margins from our 14-nanometer products. 
We expect EPS of $3.55, up 14%, excluding the ICAP net gains, driven by a strong top line growth and a lower tax rate of approximately 14%, which will increase EPS by approximately $0.28.
We expect net capital deployed of $12 billion. This reflects gross CapEx of $14 billion, offset by approximately $2 billion of customer prepayments for memory supply agreements. Increase in CapEx reflects our and our customers' confidence in our memory technology leadership.",".

What guidance did you give for the March quarter revenue?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: At the midpoint, down about 12% sequentially is a lot worse than, I guess, normal seasonal. And I guess I'm trying to figure out kind of the parameters that you guys are using to come up with that number. Was there something in the DCG strength in the calendar fourth quarter that you don't think is repeatable? Given your comments around the PC supply chain being healthy, that to me feels a little bit more seasonal than not in the March quarter. So I'm just kind of curious as to why Q1 revenue would be so much below what has been kind of the 5-year median seasonality for Q1.

2. What is the ""I guess I'm trying to figure out kind of the parameters that you guys are using to come up with that number"" comment?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: One, the enterprise growth in DCG, as Brian highlighted, was up 11% in the fourth quarter. So extremely strong seasonal growth for enterprise, a little bit more than we expected, frankly. That's number one. Number two, PSG's 35% growth was helped by end-of-life sales during the course of the quarter. And if you adjust for maybe a more normalized enterprise growth and PSG growth, you get to more of a seasonal Q4 to Q1 dynamic, so in line with seasonal if you make those 2 adjustments.

Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel Corporation:

Yes. So we had a strong quarter with enterprise growth and PSG growth, but we also increased CapEx by $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter. We're investing in our future and our customers' future and our shareholders' future."
Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: I think it was a year ago on this conference call that you kind of mentioned that you thought that calendar year '17 and calendar year '18 would be sort of above trend-line CapEx spending for you guys, and then you thought it would come down again in calendar year '19 to a more normal trend, albeit you didn't quantify the trend. Just given the big uptick in '18 to $14 billion, I realize $2 billion of that's already being covered by prepayments, but how do we think about kind of the trend-line CapEx from here, especially in light of the changing relationship between yourself and Micron on IMFT?

Question: How do you think about the trend-line CapEx from here, especially in light of the changing relationship between yourself and Micron on IMFT?

Answer: We continue to expect our CapEx to trend above our historical average. We are confident that our strong execution and growing business will support continued growth in CapEx."
Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: So my perspective is, if you take a look at it, right, memory kind of   I mean, logic on our CapEx just scaled with our increase in revenue and kind of our overall growth rate. So that's fell in line. With memory, we're going to take a look at it really on a year-by-year basis. And I'd tell you that Bob's really doing a good job of helping that business unit look over the capital. And when we have demand and people are willing to pay up front for that demand and reserve the capacity, like we've done this year, we're going to go ahead and put that capacity in place plus what we think the overall market we can do as distributing across the overall market. And that's really independent of that changing relationship with Micron.",".

Q: So you're saying that your CapEx plans are unaffected by the relationship with Micron?

A: We're going to continue to invest in our CapEx plans as long as demand is there and people are willing to pay up front for that demand."

What is the expected timeline for when Intel expects to have a product that can run on 5G networks?
Intel expects to have a product that can run on 5G networks by the end of 2020."
Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: The way we're looking at memory, and we talked a bit about this on the last call, is increased confidence in our customers and the technologies that we're developing where, those relationships, they will help fund the scaling of the capacity to grow the business. And we're really trying to match net capital employed to be in conjunction with known customer demand. So what that means   what that meant for 2017 is the net capital was roughly $1.5 billion, and we've held that relatively flat in 2018. So while gross capital is higher, we have more conviction in the customer base to fund $2 billion of the gross capital. So memory, we're really trying to focus on customer adoption of our technology to effectively and efficiently scale the business.",".

Question: What is the reasoning behind the decision to keep net capital at $1.5 billion in 2018?

Answer: The company has more conviction in the customer base to fund $2 billion of the gross capital."
Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And then just the only other point I would make on logic, remember, a year ago in terms of our outlook for growth, we're well ahead of our outlook for growth. We were probably, at the time, implied in our outlook was probably a $62.5 billion kind of number in 2018. Obviously, with our guide now, it's $65 billion. We're $2.5 billion higher. And it's that incremental growth that's placing more demands on logic capacity, both for 14-   10-nanometer and, as we think forward, on that 7-nanometer.

Joe Moore: So, I wanted to ask about OpEx. Obviously, you've been pretty disciplined there bringing that down, but you've also got some other initiatives. You've announced a discrete graphics effort. Generate one question and an answer from above paragraph.

Intel Corp.: So, we've been very disciplined in terms of our OpEx. We've been investing in our product pipeline, both in 14-nanometer and 10-nanometer, and we're also investing in our research and development. We've also announced a discrete graphics effort, which is a new business area for us. And we're seeing some good traction there."

And then, at some point, you're going to spend money on NAND that used to be shared with Micron. So just can you talk about the puts and takes there? And is there something that we should think about that's coming down to sort of offset those potential increases?

But Joe, this   really, we've already factored all of those things in. So things like the discrete graphics is a ramping spend. The memory is R&D spending out in time, so for '18 has no, really, effect.",".

So increasing in GPU spending, there's some other increases as well around things like autonomous driving and some of the other artificial intelligence and some of the emerging areas. You're right. Over time, we'll increase spending in NAND in R&D, but those are being offset by efficiencies that we're driving into the rest of our product R&D. And we really feel like we're getting to a good point where we can keep the pace of innovation going on our core products while we fund these new initiatives as well and not take a beat from our continued efficiency efforts across the spending as a percent of revenue.

We've kind of come down from 36% to 35% to 34% to a second half of 2017 at roughly 31% of revenue. So we've been coming down as we've been doing 2 things: One, the investments that we'd been making are paying off in terms of higher growth; and number two, we're making real trade-offs in where we're investing our money.

And obviously, we started out low, but we said our expectations were that it would grow throughout to the course of the year. A couple of things in the fourth quarter. Obviously, growth. So real good leverage on our existing investment was a big contributor. Secondly, ASPs were up 8%. So of the 20% growth, ASPs accounted for 8 points of that.",".

Question: So can you please speak to the sustainability of the op margin and kind of what were the drivers that got you to that level? 
Answer: So, I think the drivers for the op margin are really just a continuation of the trends we've seen over the last several years. We've been investing in new products and services, we've been investing in our manufacturing footprint, and we've been investing in our R&D capabilities. And so I think those are really the drivers for the margin growth.

Question: And then I had a follow-up as well, please. 

Answer: Sure."
Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And as Brian highlighted, whether it's cloud, comms or enterprise, customers in the quarter were really paying for performance. That performance for us was higher ASPs. Third, our continued progress on unit cost. And then, last, you may remember, last year's fourth quarter, we had some warranty- and IP-related charges in the data center business that I think cost us roughly 4 points a year ago. So last year's were a little bit deflated. But good volume leverage, strong ASPs as customers paid for performance and unit cost improving.

I think, as we go into 2018, the good   we think good cloud momentum, that's been consistent performance over the course of the year, last couple of years. Comms, our performance, we believe, was real strong in a somewhat sluggish market, so real share gains. But the high kind of seasonal enterprise growth and strong ASPs in the quarter, we think, are more seasonal in nature, and we're not anticipating enterprise growth to stay at these levels as we go into '18.

But for the last couple of years, there's   we've had maturity of 14-nanometer. And that maturity, both in terms of getting more and more performance and lower and lower unit costs, has been contributors to gross margin. As we go into '18, we see 14-nanometer modest contribution from profitability because we've matured on the cost curve. That's an increasingly competitive environment, and we don't anticipate dramatic ASP improvements over the entire company. In some cases, yes, but for the most part, no. So we'll see some continued improvement in 14-nanometer products during the course of the year. Secondly, we are really accelerating the growth of our adjacent businesses.",".

However, those   both of those product lines or businesses have lower margins. So our success in modem and memory is having a mix impact on our gross margins. The third area is we're going from 10-nanometer start-up, where our costs are coming down, to more the ramp to the 10-nanometer. And that ramp is going to weigh on the margins as we begin to develop production going into the second half of the year where we're way up the curve on where our yields and costs are. So those are kind of the 3 things as we see it, and if I were to characterize, roughly plus 1, roughly minus 2, roughly minus 1, rounding those.",".

Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And then obviously, Stacy, the higher gross capital is a bit of an offset. So stronger cash earnings, better working capital, more strategic supply, partially offset by higher CapEx.

                                                   Okay. For my follow-up, I want to ask about the growth next year of your kind of adjacent businesses versus your core businesses. Of that $65 billion of that 4%, can you give us a feeling how much of that is coming from the adjacent, I guess mostly memory and modems, versus the core? It must be decent, given the gross margin pressures. And I guess, as a corollary to that, you mentioned a one delay   1-quarter delay in data center memory. Is that   was that a statement on XPoint?

Brian M. - So Stacy, can you give us a sense of how much of the $65 billion in revenue growth next year is coming from adjacent businesses versus core businesses?"

                                                   No, that was a NAND   I'll start with just the answer to that question first, Stacy, that, that was a 3D NAND SSD. We had some delays in the fourth quarter, and those are being addressed now. So that was that comment.                                         
Stacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [27]
                                                   Okay. And growth   I'm sorry, go ahead.                                         
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [28]
                                                   No, I think, on your first question, in the $65 billion, we characterized it as roughly low single-digit decline in our PC-centric businesses. So implied in that is PC maybe declining a little bit more and modem, i.e., adjacency within the CCG segment, partially offsetting that.",".

Question: What was the implied decline in PC-centric businesses?
Answer: The implied decline in PC-centric businesses was roughly low single-digit decline."
Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: In the overall guide, we said that the data-centric businesses would be growing in the mid-teens. And obviously, that's   we believe that'll be   the strongest growth segment within the makeup of our data-centric businesses will be in memory. And it will be a function of customer quals that Brian just highlighted, and we expect NSG growth to accelerate throughout the course of 2018, so single-digit decline on PC-centric and mid-teen growth on data-centric businesses.                                         
Stacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [29]
                                                   So what does that memory strength imply for the data center growth, the DCG growth, particularly given the strong performance in Q4?

What is Intel's outlook for data center growth in 2018?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Swan,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [30]
                                                   For the most part, the [wins] for NSG that will go through data center will be late in 2018 and won't really have an impact on the overall growth rate of that business. So it's primarily about growth of 3D NAND during the course of the year.

                                                   Our next question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore.                                         
Christopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [32]
                                                   I guess a couple of housekeeping questions, if I could kind of put them together. Curious if you could share with us how you're thinking about CapEx spend between logic and memory. And then, on the 10-nanometer start-up, can you share with us when you're expecting to begin depreciating those costs?                                         
Robert H.",".

How is Intel thinking about CapEx spend between logic and memory?
Intel plans to spend the majority of its CapEx on logic and memory in 2018."
Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: Swan,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [33]
                                                   First on the CapEx, we indicated gross capital in the year of $14 billion, that we get customer strategic supply agreements of roughly $2 billion. So our net capital is $12 billion, $12 billion in the year. Again, I'd kind of break that into 2 pieces: memory, net capital employed, no change; and logic, CapEx up roughly $1 billion year-on-year. And as we mentioned earlier, that $1 billion is a function of, primarily growth, continuing to grow 14-nanometer; second, scaling up 10-nanometer; and third, investing in next node 7-nanometer during the course of the year. So those 3 things are really driving the $1 billion increase in CapEx for logic.",".

Question: What is the primary driver of the $1 billion increase in CapEx for logic?
Answer: The primary driver of the $1 billion increase in CapEx for logic is growth in 14-nanometer, 10-nanometer, and next node 7-nanometer."
Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: The second part of your question, the   so for 10-nanometer, as we bring that equipment online, we turn on   there's some equipment now that's being depreciated. But as we build   bring more online, as we ramp in the second half of the year, when we turn that equipment on is when we start depreciating it. So we'd expect our depreciation bill in the second half of the year to be growing. That's one of the contributors to   yes, really to come full circle, that's one of the contributors to the gross margin deterioration during the course of the years as we start to ramp 10-nanometer.                                         
Operator    [34]
                                                   Our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.",".

What is the reason for the gross margin deterioration during the course of the years as Intel ramps 10-nanometer?"

                                                   For the first one, Brian, I'm curious, are you baking in any effect on sales or cost or pricing from any resolution on the processor security issues? There is one line of thinking that says customers might decelerate their purchase, and then you have others in the industry saying that customers might accelerate their purchase later on. So I'm just curious how you're looking at the financial implications, positive or negative, from this issue near term and longer term.                                         
Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [36]
                                                   Sure. So we'll try and kind of break it into 2 kind of answers for that, Vivek.",". 

Q1. What are the financial implications, positive or negative, from the processor security issues?
A1. We expect the financial impact of the processor security issues to be modest."
Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: From a cost standpoint, we've baked in and we've talked about that we don't expect any material impact of this security exploit on our spending or product costs or any of that. So that's how we baked that in. From a forecast standpoint, we actually made our forecast, and we've checked it, as we go through this   the first few weeks here of the year, against our prior forecasts to make sure that the forecast incorporated any changes or any signs we're seeing up or down. And I'll tell you, at the highest level, we're not seeing much of a change in those forecasts as a result of this. So I'd tell you, it's pretty balanced right now. So spending, not material and didn't make any adds there. And then our forecast, we had a forecast.",".

Question: What impact do you think this security exploit will have on your spending or product costs?

Answer: We don't expect any material impact of this security exploit on our spending or product costs."
Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: We've checked it as we go through the first few weeks of the year, and it hasn't really changed or altered as we looked at it.                                         
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [37]
                                                   And the only other thing I'd add, per Brian's comment earlier, we kind of go into the year realizing that it's an increasingly competitive environment. And our focus is on, right now, continuing to bring the best, highest-performance products to market, but also to   lots of time and energy spent on focusing on fixing this issue, primarily through software patches as opposed to short-term hardware things.

What is the company's focus in 2017?
Intel is focusing on continuing to bring the best, highest-performance products to market and fixing the issue through software patches."
Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And as my follow-up, for the full year, how should we think about growth in just the DCG business? I understand you gave some color around the entire data-centric group, which includes memory and other segments. But just sort of apples-to-apples, how should we think about growth in just DCG, which had a very strong double-digit growth year in '17?                                         
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [39]
                                                   Yes. Throughout the course of the year, we   sorry, throughout the course of '17, we kind of guided to high single digits, and we kind of executed to that throughout. And then Q4 wasn't dramatically different than the first 3 quarters of the year, really, with the exception of the high seasonal spend for enterprise.",".

Q: What was the high seasonal spend for enterprise?
A: We had a higher spend on enterprise in Q4 due to the holiday season."
Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And that really took us from a high single-digit to low double-digit or 11% growth for the year. As we go into '18, we do not expect that   we think that, in the enterprise space, things will go back down to the negative single-digit range and, therefore, don't anticipate a dramatic difference in how we laid out DCG a year ago. So that's how we're thinking about it. If I maybe elevate that back up a little bit and just think about when we're putting together our plans for the year, there's 2 areas where our tendency is to be a little cautious on the outlook. One is PC TAM. We tend to be a little more cautious on PC TAM, and we tend to be a little more cautious as we think about enterprise growth in the DCG business.",".

Question: What is the reason for the caution on PC TAM?

Answer: We are a little more cautious on PC TAM because we think that enterprise growth in the DCG business will be a little bit slower than we had originally anticipated."
Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And the reason we do that is we think it's important to be cautious, get our costs in line. And if our assumptions on market rate to growth turn out to be conservative, we'll benefit from   we believe we'd benefit from higher volume and real strong flow-through to net income. That's how we planned the year coming into 2017, and we did kind of the same thing for 2018. So I don't anticipate dramatically different DCG growth in how we laid out 2017 as we enter 2018, because we really haven't assumed a change in trajectory of enterprise CIO spending in the course of the year.                                         
Operator    [40]

What assumptions do you have for enterprise CIO spending in 2018?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call:                                         
Blayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst    [41]
                                                   I just wanted to go back to the DCG ASPs. You had talked about the ramp of Scalable being kind of to plan, but then I think you got a nice tailwind. I think you implied enterprise had a higher percent of Scalable. So I just wondered if you could just talk on broad strokes just where the Scalable ramp is here, and how your expectation kind of getting through the year, where that could go.                                         
Brian M. Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [42]
                                                   Sure. So I'll start, and Bob can add some number detail and all. The Xeon Scalable ramp is right in line with prior ramp of similar products on our DCG road map.",".

Q: What is the percent of Xeon Scalable that is currently being shipped?
A: We are shipping about 50% of our Xeon Scalable products."
Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: And what you saw when we talked about Q4 was not necessarily more Xeon Scalable but people buying up the stock on Xeon Scalable, which drove ASP. So they're buying the higher-performance, higher-priced parts. And that's not uncommon when, at the early stages of a ramp, people come in and they typically want to buy the highest-performing parts at the beginning, and then they fill out their distribution as other buyers come in and other parts of the market kind of open up. So ramp's on schedule and aligned with prior ramps, and the ASP was more about buying up on the higher-performance parts than necessarily a volume statement.                                         
Blayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst    [43]
                                                   Got you. And then I also want to go back on just   sorry.",".

What is the ASP for Xeon Scalable processors?"
Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: I just want to go back on gross margin as well. As you look for March, you mentioned the drop is from adjacent business as well as 10-nanometer. Obviously, memory, you're signaling a big ramp, but it doesn't resolve fully. I'm just wondering if, Bob, you could just walk through the 10-nanometer start-up costs as they kind of move through the year, and kind of if you can outline, between those 2 in Q1, what's the bigger factor.                                         
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [44]
                                                   So I see mix dynamics are going to be a bigger factor overall for the year, both in Q1 and for the rest of the year, as our memory and modem business continue to accelerate strong growth. So that's going to be the biggest impact.",".

Question: What is the biggest impact on gross margin from mix dynamics? 
Answer: The biggest impact on gross margin from mix dynamics is that it will be the biggest factor in the year overall."
Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2017 Intel Corp Earnings Call: I think 10-nanometer will have an impact just right out of the gate and will kind of continue throughout the year as we scale volume, but also need to improve yields during the course of the year. So hopefully, that's helpful.

On our website, microsoft.com/investor, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call, and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP measures exclude the net impact from revenue deferrals, and the impact of integration and restructuring charges.",".

Question: What is the net impact from revenue deferrals?
Answer: The net impact from revenue deferrals is the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP revenue."
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items, to aid investors in further understanding the Company's third quarter performance, in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results.
All growth comparisons we make on the call relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We also provide growth rates in constant currency when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. At the segment level, we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin.","

What is the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company's third quarter performance?
The impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company's third quarter performance was a decrease in revenue of $0.5 billion and a decrease in gross margin of $0.2 billion, both in constant currency."
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: However, due to recent change to our external reporting segments, we aren't able to provide segment level constant currency operating expense growth, and consequently, cannot derive constant currency segment operating income either. We do provide constant currency operating expense, and operating income growth at the company-wide level.
Please note that in the third quarter of FY16, we adopted a new standard issued by the FASB, that made certain changes to accounting for stock-based compensation. One of the more significant changes require that excess tax benefits and deficiencies be recorded as part of income tax expense, rather than as part of additional paid-in capital. Adoption of the new guidance requires us to reflect adjustments as of July 1, 2015, and hence impacts our previously reported quarterly results for FY16.",".

Question: What is the impact of adopting the new guidance on previously reported quarterly results for FY16?
Answer: The impact of adopting the new guidance on previously reported quarterly results for FY16 is that excess tax benefits and deficiencies are recorded as part of income tax expense, rather than as part of additional paid-in capital."

What risks and uncertainties are you referring to?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO    [3]
                                                   Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. Overall, we had a solid quarter. Amy and I look forward to sharing more about the results, and what's ahead. We delivered $22.1 billion in revenue, with an operating income of $6.8 billion.
We exceeded $10 billion in commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate. We are halfway to our FY18 goal of $20 billion.",".

Q1. What was the company's revenue?
A. $22.1 billion"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: This quarter, we surpassed 270 million monthly active devices running Windows 10. We are proud of our progress, and look forward to making more, as enterprise deployments accelerate.
Now let's get to the specifics of each of our three segments, starting with productivity and business process. We set out to reinvent productivity and business process, because we believe that people should get more out of every moment, and organizations should be able to reach new levels of effectiveness. This approach is opening up new growth opportunity for Microsoft in three ways. We can reach more users, enter new markets, and build a developer platform.
Let me talk through each. First, we are reaching new users, and strengthening our productivity platform. Consumer subscriptions of Office grew to more than 22 million. Devices with our mobile apps grew approximately 4 times year-over-year.",".

What is the total number of consumer subscriptions of Office?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Commercial Office 365 customers surpassed 70 million monthly active users, and we grew seats by 57%.
Second, we are expanding into new markets such as security, analytics, and cloud voice, where we see an opportunity, and where we can differentiate. For example, the cybersecurity market is expanding rapidly, and it's a place where we have unique capabilities like advanced threat protection, cloud app security, and advanced e-discovery. This combination drove a 35% quarter-over-quarter growth of monthly active users of our premium information protection services in Office 365. A key driver of this growth is our new premium Office 365 Suite E5.
Lastly, we're making Office 365 more than a world-class productivity and communications service. It's becoming a growing platform for developers. There is an incredible amount of value developers can deliver by harnessing the data in this platform.",".

What is the 35% quarter-over-quarter growth of monthly active users of our premium information protection services in Office 365?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: It can be as simple as Starbucks enabling somebody to email a cup of coffee, or it can be as a sophisticated as DocuSign, streamlining processes for digital signatures based on the understanding of people's availability and organizational hierarchy.
We continue to make advances in our developer platform by expanding Microsoft Graph APIs, and opening Skype to developers. This is generating developer momentum. In fact, active apps calling on Microsoft Graph APIs are up month over month.
In business process applications, our Dynamics product line is expanding to include new scenarios such as IoT, field service, customer self-service, and built-in business intelligence and advanced analytics. For example, Echo Labs uses CRM online with Azure IoT, not only to help their customers use water systems more efficiently, but also to predict equipment failure, and direct field engineers to respond.",".

What is the increase in active apps calling on Microsoft Graph APIs month over month?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: And Just Eat in the UK uses Dynamics AX to make it easy for millions of people to order food for take-outs online. These are scenarios are driving new growth. Dynamics CRM online seats more than doubled this quarter, with over 80% of our new CRM customers deploying in the cloud. We grew Dynamics AX revenue double-digits.
Now let's move to the intelligent cloud segment. The cloud is being built into every organization's quest to optimize and grow. With our results this quarter, it remains clear, we are one of the two leaders in this market.
Azure revenue increased 120% in constant currency, with revenue from premium services growing triple-digits for the seventh consecutive quarter. We are innovating in new areas to help organizations digitally transform. We're expanding our competitive strength in hybrid computing.",".

What is the Azure revenue growth rate in constant currency?
The Azure revenue growth rate in constant currency is 120%."
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: We're generating opportunity for developers and partners.
To start, we added more differentiation to high-value services in Azure this quarter in three areas that are top of mind for our customers, artificial intelligence, IoT and business analytics. We expanded Cortana Intelligence Suite, our big data and analytics service that transforms data into predictions and intelligent action. It now includes over 20 cognitive services ranging from object and emotion recognition to text and linguistic analysis.
The IoT market is expanding as companies look to deliver new services and value. Our new Azure IoT suite streamlines the process of building IoT applications, and acts as the hub for managing and monitoring millions of assets. Each week, more than 2 trillion IoT messages are processed by Azure.",".

What is Cortana Intelligence Suite?
Cortana Intelligence Suite is a big data and analytics service that transforms data into predictions and intelligent action."
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: And analytics is another rapidly growing market, where Power BI has more than 200,000 customers and 5 million users. Companies like Toyota, BMW, Johnson Controls are all using Cortana Intelligence Suite, Azure IoT, and Power BI to transform themselves as well as their industries.
Siemens is also using Azure to connect and analyze data from medical imaging systems around the world, helping providers in their effort to transform healthcare. We're the only cloud provider that helps companies embrace the cloud on their own terms, and we continue to innovate in areas that make it easier for our customers, including the recently released preview of Azure Stack, and by bringing SQL Server to Linux.
A critical part of this flexibility is giving customers tools to secure their data, wherever it is, on-premise, in the cloud, and across all their devices.",".

What is Microsoft's strategy for expanding its cloud services?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: We continue to grow in this market with enterprise mobility suite customers more than doubling to over 27,000. This is three consecutive quarters of triple-digit customer growth. This growth is driven by strong adoption across cloud services. For example, more than one-third of our Office 365 enterprise suite installed base has also purchased Enterprise Mobility services.
And as I said earlier, perhaps the biggest impact we can make is to empower developers. To this end, we are making Windows and Azure the very best environment for developers who want to build applications that run across multiple platforms. Our acquisition of Xamarin, and the inclusion of Bash in Windows 10 will make it easier to build intelligent experiences and apps that leverage our cloud, and run natively on Windows, iOS and Android.",".

What is the biggest impact you can make to empower developers?

We are making Windows and Azure the very best environment for developers who want to build applications that run across multiple platforms. Our acquisition of Xamarin, and the inclusion of Bash in Windows 10 will make it easier to build intelligent experiences and apps that leverage our cloud, and run natively on Windows, iOS and Android."
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: We're excited to announce at Build that we're making Xamarin freely available as part of Visual Studio.
Now let's move to More Personal Computing segment. We are reinventing personal computers and personal computing for the mobile-first cloud-first world. In this world, what matters most is the mobility of a person's experience, not any one single device.
As I shared last quarter, we think about our strategy along three lines. First, we will deliver more value and innovation, particularly for enterprise customers. Second, we will grow new monetization through services across the unified Windows platform. Third, we will innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs.
First, let me talk through the innovation we're delivering that brings new levels of ease-of-use, trust, productivity to Windows, and specifically more value to our enterprise customers.",".

What is the innovation you're delivering that brings new levels of ease-of-use, trust, productivity to Windows?

We are delivering a new way to manage and secure files with Windows 10. This new feature, called File History, lets users go back in time and see all the changes they've made to files, so they can revert to a previous version if needed."
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: What we hear most frequently from these customers is how much they value the advanced productivity, security, and device management capabilities in Windows 10. In fact this is what led to one of the most security-conscious organizations in the world, the United States Department of Defense, to upgrade all of their PCs and mobile devices to Windows 10 this year. We see this trend across our enterprise customers, with 83% of them in active pilots to date.
We believe enterprise deployments will continue to drive up the over 270 million monthly active devices running Windows 10. The number of Windows 10 devices is twice that of Windows 7, over the same time period since launch.","

What is the most security-conscious organization in the world?
The United States Department of Defense"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: At Build, we gave people more reasons to upgrade with the announcement of new features in ink and touch interfaces, as well as Windows Hello biometric security, and deeper integration with Cortana, all coming this summer with the Windows 10 anniversary update.
Second, we're seeing new monetization through services across the Windows platform. Windows Store received more than 5 billion visits. We are excited about compelling new apps coming from Disney, Square Enix, Bank of America, King, Instagram and many others. We grew the number of universal Windows app developers 60% this quarter.
In search, developers have already built over 1,000 apps designed for Cortana. These new third-party experiences, and the 6.3 billion questions people have asked are helping make Cortana smarter and driving search engagement."," for a quiz.

1. What is the Windows 10 anniversary update?
2. What new features are coming in the update?
3. What is the monetization strategy for Windows?
4. What are the new apps coming from third-party developers?
5. What is Cortana doing to help make it smarter?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Over 35% of our search revenue last month came from Windows 10 devices.
In gaming, monthly active users of Xbox Live grew 26% year-over-year, driven by the growth of Xbox One and Windows 10. Xbox One continues to outpace prior generations in both reach and engagement. At the same time, we continue to create synergies between Xbox One and Windows 10 devices. Bringing top Xbox One titles to Windows Store helped grow gaming hours on Windows 10 by 50% over last quarter. And starting this summer, universal Windows apps will run on Xbox One, making it easy to build applications and games that work across devices.
Third, we continue to innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs. We're pleased with the results from Surface this quarter.",".

What was the growth in Xbox Live active users?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: This is our second $1 billion revenue quarter for Surface in a row, and it's the first outside of a holiday period. Revenue grew 61% in constant currency, driven by Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. Certainly, consumers value these devices, but where we see the strongest momentum is through adoption in the commercial space, with particular strength in financial services, manufacturing, and healthcare.
Our OEM partners are also innovating in new device areas for consumers and business customers. In particular, they too, are seeing growth in the two-in-one device category. As you can see, we think about renewing growth of Windows, we think broadly about where growth can come from. We see early signs of success in Windows driving increased engagement and monetization of services like search, store and gaming, as well as new sources of revenue from Surface.",".

Question: What is the company's outlook for the commercial market?
Answer: The company sees strong momentum in the commercial space, with particular strength in financial services, manufacturing, and healthcare."
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: As we build premium devices and premium categories, we're also stimulating demand across our entire ecosystem.
Ultimately, the largest potential for Microsoft's growth will come through reinvention of personal computers and personal computing, as well as the new platforms we create. This broader mobile-first cloud-first opportunity cuts across all of our financial segments and technology ambition. And this is what we shared with developers at Build, and with business leaders at EnVision a few weeks ago. I hope you have had the chance to watch these events as well.
We are creating entirely new ways for people to interact with technology, and also new ways for them to build technology. HoloLens developer kit is one such example.",".

What is the largest potential for Microsoft's growth?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Organizations around the world like Volvo and NASA are using HoloLens to redefine what it means to build and explore, and Case Western University is redefining how students learn to be world-class surgeons.
Conversational interfaces is another example. We envision a world where people will more naturally interact with their devices in the future through conversation. Imagine simply asking Cortana to book a hotel, or being able to order a pizza through an instant message in Skype. Conversations will be a new platform that every business, every app, and every website will begin to embrace, and we're at the forefront driving this platform shift.","

What is the company's vision for conversational interfaces?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: We are building out cloud services and platform to enable every business, across every industry to digitally transform themselves, and in turn build their own capability to create more digital technology.
Empowering people and organizations to thrive in this digital world is central to Microsoft's mission. I'm proud of our execution so far, and what we have achieved, and I'm also grounded in the work ahead of us. With that, I'll hand over to Amy to go through this quarter's results in greater detail, and share our outlook for the next quarter. And I look forward to rejoining you, after that to answer questions.                                         
Amy Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - CFO    [4]
                                                   Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $22.1 billion, up 2%, and up 5% in constant currency.",. Q: What was the main driver of the revenue growth? A: The main driver of the revenue growth was the growth of our cloud services and platform.
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Gross margin declined slightly, but was up 4% in constant currency. We grew operating income this quarter by 1%, and 10% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $0.62, flat year-over-year, and up 10% in constant currency. Our effective tax rate was 24%, higher than we anticipated, which impacted our EPS.
From a geographic perspective, our performance in most markets was as anticipated. However, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa were more unfavorable than we expected. In our commercial business, we continued to see healthy fundamentals which led to a solid quarter of results. Commercial bookings increased 7%, up 9% in constant currency.
Our total commercial annuity business had double-digit revenue growth in constant currency, and commercial annuity mix reached 86%, up 4 points year-over-year.",".

What was the main reason for the increase in EPS?
The main reason for the increase in EPS was due to the growth in operating income and constant currency."
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Commercial unearned revenue grew to just under $18.8 billion, up 3% and 8% in constant currency, slightly below expectations due to a higher mix of contracts with more in-period recognition, and some deal weakness in the geographic markets mentioned earlier. Our contracted not billed balance again exceeded $25 billion. Most important, as Satya mentioned earlier, our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate surpassed $10 billion.
This quarter, more than 65% of customers who signed enterprise agreements attached our commercial cloud offers, up 15 points from last year. Our customers continue to make long-term commitments based on our compelling road map. Our commercial cloud gross margin was 45% this quarter, declining year-over-year.",".

Question: What was the main reason for the decline in commercial cloud gross margin?
Answer: The decline in commercial cloud gross margin was due to a higher mix of contracts with more in-period recognition, and some deal weakness in the geographic markets mentioned earlier."
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: This decrease was driven by a higher mix of Azure revenue, our ongoing investment in data center capacity and geographic expansion, and a small FX headwind.
As I mentioned last quarter, even as we're focused on gross margin improvement within each of our key cloud services, our total commercial cloud gross margin will reflect the dynamics of change in revenue mix, and targeted investment. In Q3, the FX impact of 3 points on year-over-year revenue growth was generally in line with the guidance, as the recent weakening in the US dollar created less than 1 point of impact overall, and across segments.
As Chris explained earlier, we're not able to provide constant currency impact at the segment level for operating expenses, and therefore segment operating income.",".

What is the FX headwind impacting commercial cloud gross margin?
The FX headwind impacting commercial cloud gross margin is impacting the revenue mix and targeted investment."
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: In general, FX had a favorable impact of 1 point on operating expenses at the total Company level. As expected, our Company gross margin percentage declined this quarter, driven by our accelerating mix of cloud services, in our intelligent cloud, and productivity and business processes segment, offset by higher gross margin percentage performance from products within More Personal Computing.
Now to our segment results. This quarter, our productivity and business processes segment delivered in line with our expectations, with $6.5 billion in revenue increasing 1% and 6% in constant currency, with higher annuity mix offsetting lower transactional weakness results due to a weaker PC market. In office commercial, revenue was flat, and grew 7% in constant currency, driven by continued momentum in Office 365, with installed base growth across Office, Exchange, SharePoint, and Skype Workloads.","

What was the impact of FX on operating expenses at the total company level?
The impact of FX on operating expenses at the total company level was 1 point."
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Our channel again expanded this quarter, as more than 85,000 transacting partners sold Office 365 to small business customers.
Office consumer revenue increased 3% and 6% in constant currency, due to an increasing base of subscribers and recurring subscription revenue, and our dynamics business grew 4%, up 9% in constant currency. We more than doubled CRM online seats for the sixth consecutive quarter. Segment gross margin dollars declined 4%, up 1% in constant currency.
As we've discussed, gross margin percentage declined on a higher cloud services revenue mix within the segment. Operating expenses decreased 1%, even as we continued engineering investments in our Office 365 and dynamics businesses, and prioritized spend in growth areas like E5, security and voice capabilities.",".

What was the main reason for the decline in gross margin percentage?
The main reason for the decline in gross margin percentage was due to a higher cloud services revenue mix within the segment."
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: As a result, operating income declined 7%.
The intelligent cloud segment delivered $6.1 billion in revenue, which grew 3% and 8% in constant currency, just at the low end of our guidance range. Our total server products and cloud services revenue was flat year-over-year, and increased 5% in constant currency against a prior year comparable that had 16% constant currency growth. This quarter, our enterprise server customers continued their commitment to our hybrid cloud platform offerings, which resulted in double-digit annuity revenue growth in constant currency, including over 100% growth in Azure. That growth was partially offset by a larger than expected decline in our transactional on-premise server business, which impacted the in-quarter results.
Enterprise services continued to perform well, with 11% revenue growth or 15% in constant currency, driven by customer demand for our support services and solutions.",".

What was the main reason for the decline in operating income?
The main reason for the decline in operating income was the decline in the transactional on-premise server business."
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Gross margin declined 2%, and grew 3% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage declined, as cloud mix accelerated, offsetting margin improvements in Azure and enterprise services.
In response to enterprise customer demand, and to increase our share in the cloud market, we grew operating expenses by 13% through Azure-focused investments across engineering, additional sales and marketing capacity, and the acquisition of Xamarin. This quarter, operating income declined 14%.
Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing. Revenue exceeded our expectations at $9.5 billion, up 1% and 3% in constant currency. First, our OEM results. Our total OEM business declined 2% this quarter, outperforming the overall PC market which was weaker than we expected. OEM non-Pro revenue increased 15%, driven primarily by a higher than expected mix of premium devices.",".

What caused the OEM results to decline this quarter?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: OEM Pro revenue underperformed the commercial PC market, declining 11%, due to the higher inventory level in Q2, that I mentioned in my last earnings commentary.
Windows volume licensing grew 6% in constant currency, and IP licensing continued to decline, impacted by both a decrease in total unit volume, and a higher mix of lower royalty units. As expected, devices revenue decreased this quarter. Revenue declined 11% or 9% in constant currency, primarily due to phone, where revenue declined 46% in constant currency. Additionally, sell-through of our Lumia products was weak, and we exited the quarter with relatively high channel inventory. As Satya mentioned, momentum in our Surface business continued, as revenue increased 56% or 61% in constant currency, with strong commercial and consumer demand for our Surface lineup.",".

Question: What was the main reason for the decline in OEM Pro revenue?
Answer: The higher inventory level in Q2 impacted OEM Pro revenue, as it decreased the number of units sold."
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Overall, device gross margin dollars grew, and gross margin percentage improved, primarily driven by a shift to our higher gross margin Surface portfolio.
Our search business remains strong this quarter, with growth driven by higher revenue per search, and higher search volume. We again had US PC share growth, and search continued to be profitable. In gaming, revenue grew 4% or 6% in constant currency, with continued progress in the monetization of our installed base. We saw higher revenue from Xbox Live, driven by both higher volumes of transactions, and higher revenue per transaction, as well as an increase in revenue from our gaming studios.","

What was the main driver of gross margin dollars growth in Q3 2016?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: As expected, Xbox hardware revenue declined, mainly driven by lower Xbox 360 consoles sold, and lower Xbox One pricing.
Segment gross margin increased 2% or 6% in constant currency, driven primarily by gross margin percentage improvements in devices and gaming. Operating expenses decreased 14%, primarily through our actions in phone, and the transition of our display business to AOL. As a result, segment operating income grew 57%.
Now back to our overall Company results. As planned, we accelerated our data center and cloud services investments to meet growing global demand. This quarter, we invested $2.3 billion in total capital expenditures, including an increase of 65% year-over-year primarily for data centers and servers.",".

Question: What was the main driver of gross margin percentage improvements in devices and gaming?
Answer: Gross margin percentage improvements in devices and gaming were primarily driven by gross margin percentage improvements in devices and gaming."
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Other income was negative $247 million, driven by interest expense and net losses on derivatives, partially offset by dividends, interest income, and net recognized gains on investments.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24%, higher than we expected, which reflected the changing mix of revenue across geographies, as well as an accelerating shift in revenue from software licensing to cloud services. The rate for the quarter included a catch-up adjustment from Q1 and Q2, reflecting the new full-year   the new expected full-year non-GAAP effective tax rate. This quarter, we returned $6.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Now let's move to the outlook. First on FX, consistent with our guidance last quarter, we still expect FX to negatively impact year-over-year growth in Q4 by 3 points.",".

What is the company's outlook for FX impacting year-over-year growth in Q4?
The company expects FX to negatively impact year-over-year growth in Q4 by 3 points."
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: By segment, we expect 3 points of impact on productivity and business processes, 3 points in intelligent cloud, and 2 points in More Personal Computing.
Second, our commercial business. Our commercial business will be on pace for continued strong annuity growth, as both new and existing enterprise customers adopt and use our growing portfolio of cloud services. Even with projections of tightening global IT spend and currency headwinds, we expect commercial unearned revenue to be $24.3 billion to $24.5 billion, in line with historic seasonality. We remain on track toward our $20 billion commercial cloud revenue run rate goal, as we grow revenue, drive consumption, and focus on gross margin improvement in Office 365, Azure and Dynamics online.",".

Question: What are the three points of impact on productivity and business processes?
Answer: The three points of impact on productivity and business processes are expected to be in the areas of intelligent cloud, More Personal Computing, and commercial unearned revenue."
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Finally, we will continue our investment in data centers and capital equipment to address customer demand for our cloud services.
With that, let me share our view by segment. In productivity and business processes, we expect revenue to be $6.5 billion to $6.7 billion, with continued annuity shift to the cloud, offsetting the impact of a weaker PC market on our transactional business in our consumer and commercial segments. In intelligent cloud, we expect revenue between $6.5 billion to $6.7 billion, driven by annuity growth, offset by continued transactional weakness.
In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $8.7 billion and $9 billion. Here's a bit more detail on its individual components. In Windows, we expect our OEM Pro revenue to be largely in line with the commercial PC market.",".

What is the company's view on the PC market?
The company expects its OEM Pro revenue to be largely in line with the commercial PC market."
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Our non-Pro revenue is expected to be above the consumer PC market, similar to what we saw in Q3, primarily due to the continued benefit from a strong mix of premium devices.
In devices, we anticipate continued momentum and growth for Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, particularly with business customers. For phone, we expect year-over-year revenue declines to steepen in Q4, as we work through our Lumia channel position. In search, we will continue to show healthy revenue growth, with full-year profitability. Finally in gaming, we expect to see continued healthy user engagement on our Xbox platform, and we look forward to E3, where we will announce new titles for the upcoming fiscal year.
We expect COGS to be $7.8 billion to $7.9 billion. We expect operating expenses between $8.2 billion and $8.3 billion.",".

What is the expected mix of premium devices in Q3 2016?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Our full-year guidance is now down to $31 billion to $31.1 billion, as we concentrate our investments in engineering and technical sales, to accelerate our cloud growth heading into the next fiscal year.
We expect other income and expenses to be negative $200 million in Q4. This includes the net cost of hedging and interest expense, offset by dividend and interest income. For tax, based on trends reflected in this quarter's full-year catch-up adjustment, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be 21% and 23%. We expect our full-year effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21%.
Before I wrap up, I'd like to share a few directional comments on FY17. This year, we saw strong growth in our commercial cloud portfolio, and we grew our annuity penetration across our commercial business.",".

As we continue to unify and modernize our Windows installed base across our business customers, we will advance our progress in our post sale monetization scenarios, and execute on the Windows 10 enterprise deployment opportunity. Throughout FY16, our significant investment in engineering, sales and marketing has positioned us to support our customers' digital transformations, and to innovate in device form factors like Surface and HoloLens. In FY17, we expect to continue that investment, and reallocation process, therefore total operating expenses should be flat to up slightly. I look forward to sharing more on our FY17 plans in July.

                                                   Good afternoon. Amy, just on the Q4 guide. You're guiding below the Street on many of the individual line items on the top line. I'm just curious, is this more of the shift to the cloud, or is there some demand execution issues that you're seeing in the business?                                         
Amy Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - CFO    [3]
                                                   Thanks, Brent. It's really, as we talked about, transactional weakness in productivity and business process. We're continuing to expect strong annuity growth. We're continuing to expect a strong mix to the cloud. We're continuing to expect ARPU increases, premium mix increases, and installed base growth.",".

Q1. What is the main reason for the weak transactional demand?
A1. Weak transactional demand is due to weak productivity and business process."
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: So really, in that segment, it's the PC weakness, and our traditional transactional office business that's impacting that segment.
In intelligent cloud, it's a very similar dynamic. We're expecting renewal rates to remain strong as they've been. We're expecting the mix to Azure to continue to grow. We're expecting annuity double-digit revenue growth. And again, it's the transactional weakness that you're seeing overall, as well some   the very specific geo weakness that we saw, which I called out earlier.
And in More Personal Computing, the largest change in that segment is frankly the phone. So I would really focus on that in that segment. The rest of it, frankly, is quite good.

                                                   Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a great quarter. I just want to focus in on Office here. Obviously, you called out Office 365 commercial suite growing 57% year-over-year, so very consistent with what your last quarter was. And Satya, you mentioned the mix shift as well with the release of E5.",". 

1. What is the mix shift for Office 365 commercial suite? 
2. What was the top selling product in Office 365 commercial suite in Q3 2016?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Wonder if you can just provide some color there, sort of a I guess, a grade of where you are right now? And then, as you're contemplating guidance for Q4, and then thinking about 2017, how should we think   or how are you guys thinking about that Office 365 transition there, sort of units and pricing?                                         
Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO    [8]
                                                   I can start, and then Amy, you can add. Overall, the thing that we are most focused on with Office 365 is how do we make sure that we have the Office 365 endpoints everywhere and good usage. And I talked about how the mobile endpoints has been growing, and the mobile usage has been growing. I also talked about the 70 million monthly active users of Office.",".

Q: How is Office 365 mobile usage growing?
A: The mobile usage of Office 365 is growing 70 million monthly active users."
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: So we feel very good about that, which is users, both in terms of coverage and usage.
The next place where we're very focused on is really the new scenarios, and E5 is obviously a big element of it. I talked about it in some detail, the security value proposition. That is really showing a lot of good traction for us, but we're also seeing traction in analytics and voice. So we're in the very early innings of E5, but the value proposition and the TAM, or the total addressable market of those three scenarios is huge. And so, we remain very excited about it.
The other thing that I'm also excited about, when it comes to Office 365, is for the first time we're opening up Office 365.",":

What is the total addressable market for three scenarios in Office 365?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Not just as an end-user, and a enterprise tool and a service, but as a developer platform. In its own right, we think of Office as perhaps one of the most strategic developer assets we have, and with the Microsoft Graph API, and what we see as activity around it. We think about the platform effects of that, as also being very key. So that's, at least at the macro level, how I look at it. And Amy, if you want to talk a little more about it ?                                         
Amy Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - CFO    [9]
                                                   And I think that the way that shows itself in our financial results is, you'd expect to continue to see the strong mix shift to the cloud.",".

What is the Microsoft Graph API?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: You'd expect to continue to see installed base growth, as even some of the items Satya talked about have more relevance, and continue to make us, the value prop higher, even in small business, which is where you've seen new user adds. I would continue to expect to see ARPU growth, as we see E5 have its impact through the year. And so, think about these same dynamics, Phil, for us, where we focus on new users, and ARPU increases, as we shift to Office 365, those are trends I'd expect to see, obviously as we look into 2017.

                                                   Sure. Thank you very much. So if you look at productivity and process and intelligent cloud, obviously we're having a margin decrease that's occurring, and a good chunk of that is cloud. How should we think about the standalone license business, in terms of the margins, separated from the cloud side of it?                                         
Amy Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - CFO    [14]
                                                   The standalone margins on the licensing business have been pretty stable. Just because transactionally, we understand and continue to bring down the fixed cost base there, and any that's required. So I don't feel like you'd expect any material change in those, Mark.

                                                   Great. Thank you so much. Satya, I wanted to see if you could share a little bit on Azure? Just how you're thinking about the competitive positioning, versus Amazon, where you think your strengths are, versus them? And also, as the business continues to ramp at such a fast pace, how do we think about the progression in gross margins? I mean, Amazon gives us operating margins. But I guess, I'm wondering, is there a reason you shouldn't be able to reach similar operating margins with Azure at a similar scale, if we went back and looked at the progression that Amazon's been disclosing?                                         
Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO    [20]
                                                   Sure, Heather. Thanks for the question."," for that question.

What is Azure's competitive positioning?

Azure's competitive positioning is to provide a cloud platform that can be used by both large organizations and small businesses."
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: First of all, when Amy and I think about both our CapEx, as well as our OpEx, both on the engineering side, as well as on our sales and marketing side, we think about this still at a Microsoft cloud level. Just because if you take something like enterprise mobility suite, that gives you an indication of how, for example, we attach to Office 365, essentially an infrastructure service that hasn't [SaaS-like] margins. Or even some of our application services in Azure that attach to office developer experiences. So we think about this part more holistically, and same thing with dynamics.
But having said that, if   to your specific question, of where our differentiation lies? The first one is hybrid. Most people think about hybrid where, they think about the cloud as the edge of their server.",".

1. What is Microsoft's differentiation in the hybrid market?
2. How does Microsoft attach to Office 365?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: We obviously support that with all of our service. Every server product of ours has cloud enrollment rights, whether it be SQL, whether it be Windows server, and you'll see that increasingly, even in this next wave of servers.
But we also think of, in fact, our servers as the edge of our cloud. That I think is where the world is going to go to, where distributed computing will remain distributors. So Azure Stack is completely unique to Microsoft. No one else who is in the public cloud business at any scale has that kind of capability. So, I would say that's another point of differentiation.
So to your point about margins, I feel that we actually will have software licenses with hybrid rights. That's a different margin structure.",".

What is Azure Stack unique to Microsoft?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: We will have [IAS] services, and you talked about the existence proof, at least from Amazon about what margins at scale can be achieved there. We have PaaS services in infrastructure like EMS that have SaaS-like rev margins. And then, of course, we have SaaS services in Office 365.
So I think the mix of our gross   or rather that mix will define a long-term gross margin, and operating margin for our cloud services. But the mix will also shift each quarter, just because the mix is not a stable mix, we'll see growth in different in parts, at different times.

Amy, when you're talking about the transactional declines particularly (technical difficulty) and the server portion of that, can you help us understand how much of that is due to maybe more macro factors, weaker overall spending environment, and how much of that comes from perhaps demand being reallocated towards infrastructure-as-a-service offerings that you guys have in Azure?

There's clearly a macro impact, especially on the transactional business.",.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Transactional businesses tend to be more impacted in emerging markets, where we have a higher percentage of new   of non-annuity business as transactional business. Those have been the weakest markets in this macro environment, and specifically some of the geos we called out have more exposure in this place. And so, you're certainly seeing the macro impact in the intelligent cloud segment, in the server weaknesses there.
And because frankly, we saw that macro weakness, you've even seen it, in terms of server shipments, right? If you look at server shipments, you'd say that's actually a macro statement. We didn't see it any one particular workload.","

What are the weak markets in this macro environment?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: It's weakness across workloads, which tends to make more sense, frankly, with a macro or a budget IT spend constraint.
And so, I actually think between those two items, it's the biggest impact that we've seen in the quarter. And I expect to see it again next quarter, given I don't think the macro or IT spend environment should change in any way between these two quarters. So I think less about it being cannibalistic, because so many of the scenarios in this time period, we've seen the growth we expected. We've seen it across our premium services, as well as core compute.",".

Question: What impact do you think the macro or IT spend environment will have on Microsoft's growth in the next quarter?
Answer: We expect it to have a minimal impact on our growth in the next quarter."
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: I should also say most of the weakness we saw was in the standard workloads, which I think lends itself again to some of those pressures.
We also saw and I would expect annuity shifts there, which is the final component. Our annuity numbers and renewal numbers were very good in intelligent cloud. And in fact, they came right where we expected, in terms of unearned balances. And so, for me I do tend to think it's a bit more on the macro pressure and budget impacts than it is, frankly, any other statement or execution.

If I take the midpoint of your revenue guidance, the midpoint of your COGS guidance, it looks like you're guiding to another roughly 200 basis point decline in gross margins in the June quarter, which is about what you did in March.
So if we look out to FY17, I know you touched on it a little bit, but just to be clear, it feels like you're guiding to a further year-over-year decline in gross margins. But it sounds like that will be offset in part by a continued good OpEx control.",".

What is the company's guidance for gross margins in the June quarter?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: So is that the right way to think about it? And is there any way that you could sort of bracket what the gross margin percentage decline might be in FY17? You probably don't want to give specific guidance, but maybe some high level color?

                                                   Directional. Karl, thanks for the question. And you're right, in general, and let me spend a few seconds on that. You're right, we saw about a 200 basis point change this quarter. It's entirely due to the shift to the cloud, both in our productivity and business process segment, as well as the intelligent cloud segment. Those are the exact same drivers in the gross margin change that we guided to in Q4.",".

Q: So is that the right way to think about it? And is there any way that you could sort of bracket what the gross margin percentage decline might be in FY17?
A: We don't want to give specific guidance, but some high level color would be helpful."

And so, as you think about 2017, with the continued acceleration of our cloud mix, and actually continued momentum in annuity, I would to see the same   the same pressures continue to exist. And you're right, in that our strong operating expense focus, because really this is the quarter when you've been able to see actually in Q2 and Q3 now, us really pivoting that investment in OpEx to our intelligent cloud, and the opportunity we see there across engineering, sales and marketing. And you're right, we do expect to see, and continue to do that as we lead into 2017, within the overall envelope I discussed.

                                                   Hi, thanks. Amy, my question just on guidance, and your posture on guidance, a two-part question. I think we've seen you give very conservative guidance say, for the first half of the year. And in Q3, you ended up, putting it all together, at the lower end of your guidance.",. What changed in the second half of the year that caused you to change your guidance?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: And I'm wondering   your posture, just generally around guidance, if it's changed at all, that you're factoring in things differently, and we should think about that range going forward? Should it be more like it's been in the past, where you've had very conservative assumptions, or more like what you just did here?
And then, the second part is, as you look forward maybe towards longer-term guidance, and the prospects of giving longer-term guidance, because I don't think I've seen an estimate spread on a company as large as this, in a long time, how are you thinking about possibly giving long-term guidance? What the factors that are influencing your comfort in doing that? Or is it more philosophical, and it's something you're just not going to do, that's not necessarily dependent on your view of the business?

What has changed with guidance assumptions at Microsoft?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: My philosophical position doesn't change much. I give the guidance that I expect for the quarter, and I do it on the earnings call to the best of my ability.
What you've seen this quarter is in fact the biggest in-quarter delta for us all the time is the non-annuity performance, than in our   all of our segments, that is transactional business, that is the most impacted in quarter, by budget changes or macro changes. And so, the inherent volatility that you are talking about really, is about changes in quarter that we see and the impact of that.
So I don't think it's a philosophical shift. It's just where you see volatility in quarter has always been in the transactional side of our business.",".

So I tend to think   I'll talk a little bit about 2017, as I always do come July, give you all more of a shape to that. But I tend to think, I would like to focus on where the Company is going, which is cloud mix shift, annuity growth, and overall world view of bringing Windows and the ecosystem growth through MPC.

What is the outlook for annuity renewals in 2017?"

                                                   Thanks a lot. Amy, I just wanted to go back on the intelligent cloud. We did see that deceleration in server product growth, but the comp was very tough. And as you commented, your annuity was up, and your deferred growth accelerated. That server product line has grown about 5% constant currency in the last 12 months.
I guess the question is, is there any structural reason why, going back to Keith's question, why that would decelerate more ex macro? And then, another question I just had that's related to this. Can you just remind us, in the server product ex Azure line, and in the commercial office traditional non 365 line, how much is transactional in those two segments? Thank you.

Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Ross, let me try to take this. The first question around, is there anything structural or different in that server product line? Really, it has been, and is that transactional component. You're right, we continue to see the annuity growth. We continue see the growth through Azure, and the offset to that has been the transactional business.
I'm not sure that I would say that there's any structural reason, other than   that's changed my world view, other than maybe the budget and macro pressure tends to exert itself on that transactional business.","

What is the reason for the slowdown in the transactional business?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: But overall, continuing to see the renewals we've seen, continuing to see the cloud growth we've seen, I'm not sure I think of it as a fundamental trajectory change, outside of that component we discussed.
In terms of overall, rough orders of magnitude, the intelligent cloud segment has the least exposure to the transactional business. It's still less than 20%, but that 20%, right, lends itself in quarter to the volatility you see. The productivity and business process segment has a bit more transactional exposure, just because it has both the consumer and commercial office business, which is more attached on a transactional basis to PCs. So it's slightly higher, all up.

What incremental opportunity does Microsoft see in its Windows 10 operating system?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Satya, I wanted to talk a little bit just about the ISV ecosystem on top of Azure, and where you think that is today, and where you'd hope that potentially to be in 12 months, when we think about the opportunity around sort of platform-as-a-service, and building out more enterprise apps? I think you made some comments around some IoT applications that are now sitting on Azure.
What is sort of a good   what should we be looking for in terms of new partners? On, from a survey, ISV perspective, you've had companies like BlackBox who re-platformed? I'm wondering, do you expect that momentum to potentially accelerate, as we get further into the calendar year? Thanks.                                         
Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO    [56]

What is your expectation for the ISV ecosystem on top of Azure in the next 12 months?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: I mean, I think the overall for me, across all of our product lines, whether it be Windows or whether it'd be Office 365 or Azure, developer momentum, ISV momentum is super important priority for us, both in terms of our developer evangelism, our product engineering teams, as well as everything that we will do to even create success for our partners, through our field sales organization is a top of mind priority. And this is something that Kevin Turner, myself, and Amy, and all of our leadership team is very focused on.","

Q: What is your strategy for generating developer momentum?
A: Our strategy for generating developer momentum is to focus on our product engineering teams, as well as our developer evangelism efforts."
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: So you will only increasingly see us deliver more design wins there.
In fact, I'm looking forward to our partner conference, to talk much more about what it is that we will be doing in the coming year, to drive more success for our partners, and in particular, ISVs. The thing that I'm seeing a lot of, is we've had traditional strength with SQL as well as dot-net. They are moving a significant number of them to the cloud, and in fact replatting, to be even multi-tenant cloud native.
At the same time, we're also seeing a lot of open source ISVs also join   be part of the Azure marketplace. If you go up to the Azure marketplace, surely you will see that.",".

Q: What is Azure marketplace?
A: Azure marketplace is a marketplace where Microsoft partners can sell their services and products."
Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: So we are not only bringing people who have traditionally worked with us, helping them replat to a completely new model, but we're also bringing a lot of new ISVs into the fold as well.

(Operator Instructions) 
As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.                                          
Chris Suh,  Microsoft Corporation - General Manager of IR    [2]
                                        
Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. 
On our website, microsoft.com/investor you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. 
Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on today's call.",".

Q1 2016 GAAP net income was $20.8 billion, or $0.79 per share. This compares to $21.5 billion, or $0.81 per share, in Q1 2015.

What was the main driver of the decrease in GAAP net income in Q1 2016?

The main driver of the decrease in GAAP net income in Q1 2016 was a $2.5 billion charge related to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets."
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: The non-GAAP measures exclude the net impact from revenue deferrals and the impact of integration and restructuring charges. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the Company's second-quarter performance, in addition to the impact of these items and events had on the financial results. 
All growth comparisons we make on the call relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. At the segment level we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin.",".

What are the non-GAAP financial measures that Microsoft Corp uses to evaluate its performance?

The non-GAAP financial measures exclude the net impact from revenue deferrals and the impact of integration and restructuring charges."
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: However, due to recent change in our segment reporting groupings we aren't able to provide segment level constant currency operating expense growth. And consequently cannot derive constant currency segment operating income either.  We do provide constant currency operating expense and operating income growth at the Company-wide level. 
Please note that we have recast certain prior period items to conform to the current period presentation  with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flow. Additionally, any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our form 10Q and includes research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative, but excludes the impact of last year's integration and restructuring charges. 
We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available.",".

What is the impact of the change in segment reporting groupings on operating expense and operating income growth?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If  you ask a question, it will be included on our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until January 27, 2017. 
During this call we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the risk factors section of our form 10K, form 10Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","

What are forward-looking statements?

Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts and are generally, but not always, identified by the words ""expects,"" ""anticipates,"" ""plans,"" ""believes,"" ""estimates,"" ""projects,"" ""will,"" ""should,"" ""could,"" ""might"" or similar expressions."

Thank you Chris. Good afternoon everyone. Today Amy and I will share the results of our second quarter and look ahead. 
Overall this quarter we had solid performance, and more importantly drove growth in areas that are key to our future. We delivered $25.7 billion in revenue with an operating income of $7.9 billion. We continue to advance towards our goals for FY18. Our commercial cloud run rate surpassed $9.4 billion, up over 70% year over year, and almost halfway to our goal of $20 billion. We nearly doubled our cloud customers over the last 12 months.",".

Thank you, everyone. This is Satya. In the second quarter, we delivered $25.7 billion in revenue and $7.9 billion in operating income. We continue to advance towards our goals for FY18. Our commercial cloud run rate surpassed $9.4 billion, up over 70% year over year, and almost halfway to our goal of $20 billion. We nearly doubled our cloud customers over the last 12 months. We generated $5.2 billion in cash flow from operations. And with $26.5 billion in total assets, we are well on our way to achieving our goal of $100 billion in total shareholder value by the end of FY18. With strong execution and continued growth in our key businesses, we are well positioned for future success.
One question.

Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement."
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: 
We also made progress towards our goal of more than $1 billion Windows 10 monthly active devices. We crossed the 200 million milestone, and Windows 10 is outpacing adoption of any of our previous operating systems. In fact, adoption is nearly 140% faster than Windows 7. I appreciate the incredible work and focus of both Microsoft team members and our partners to deliver these results. 
Now let's get to the specifics for each of the three segments, starting with Productivity and Business Process. As we seek to help people get more out of every moment, we're delivering new innovation and seeing new opportunity with Office 365. Consumer response to Office is strong. Office attach rate is up. Office 2016 adoption is outperforming Office 2013 over the same period of time. And consumer subscriptions are up to more than 20 million.",".

What is the Office attach rate?
The Office attach rate is the number of times a user attaches or opens an Office document, such as a Word document, within 30 days after installation."
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: We are also enthusiastic about how people use Office on other platforms. On iOS and Android, Skype is more than 900 million downloads and Office apps surpass 340 million this quarter. There also 13 million iOS and Android active devices running Outlook. 
Office 365 Commercial revenue grew nearly 70% in constant currency, while seats grew 59%. It is clear customers value the ongoing innovation we're delivering in Office 365 and this allows us to advance further into markets like voice and information protection. In December we released a major update to Skype for Business which drives productivity up and costs down. Our customers can now use Skype for Business to get a dial tone without the need of their own PBX and conduct online meetings for up to 10,000 attendees.",".

What is the total number of downloads for Skype on iOS and Android?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: 
Security is both a mandate and an opportunity for Microsoft across all of our segments. As customers look to protect themselves, we are creating new demand for all of our security solutions. The number of people using our information protection capabilities built into Office 365 increased 25% quarter over quarter. At the same time, we released new capabilities like advanced [ware] protection, advanced E-discovery and customer lock box. These new innovations in voice and information protection accrue to our premium productivity and collaboration skew, E5, which we released last month. 
Our Dynamics business is also contributing to our growth in the cloud. This quarter we released major updates to Dynamics NAV and Dynamics CRM, both of which deliver enhancements in mobility, insights, and organizational productivity as well as deeper integration with Azure and Office 365.",".

What is the number of people using Microsoft's information protection capabilities built into Office 365 increasing 25% quarter over quarter?
The number of people using Microsoft's information protection capabilities built into Office 365 increased by 25% quarter over quarter."
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Three out of four of our CRM customers are choosing to deploy in the cloud, which is driving continued triple digit paid seat growth for CRM online in the enterprise. 
Our momentum with Office 365 and Dynamics creates a compelling case for developers. This quarter we exposed the data APIs which capture the relationships between people, conversations, projects, schedules, processes and content. We call these APIs the Microsoft Graph. The ability for developers to build on the Microsoft Graph presents a strategic opportunity for customers and partners. Smartsheet has already taken advantage of these APIs. Oracle plans to use Microsoft Graph to enhance their line of business applications, like Oracle Sales Cloud, and many innovative startups are extending it to create new generation of productivity applications. 
Now let's move to the Intelligent Cloud segment.",".

What is the Microsoft Graph?
The Microsoft Graph is a set of APIs that allow developers to build applications that can access data from the Microsoft Office 365 and Dynamics 365 platforms."
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: The enterprise cloud opportunity is massive, larger than any market we have ever participated in. Last quarter I reflected on how we are now one of the two leaders in this space. At the same time, we are the only one in this market providing SaaS, PasS, IaaS and hybrid cloud at scale. We are growing in each of these areas simultaneously. 
Our unique approach is resonating. Our cloud architecture reflects real-world distributed cloud computing needs and services that enable businesses to convert data into intelligence and drive business transformation. Azure revenue grew 140% this quarter in constant currency, with revenue coming from new and existing customers. We saw organizations like NTT DOCOMO, Honeywell, NASA's jet propulsion labs, Dow Chemical and the UN Development Program deploy innovative solutions on Azure.","

What is the enterprise cloud opportunity?

The enterprise cloud opportunity is massive, larger than any market we have ever participated in."
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: 
We see that Azure customers who also purchase Office 365 consume 8 times more Azure than other customers. More than 70% of the Fortune 500 have at least two different Microsoft cloud offerings, up 13 points year over year. And now we are continuing to grow in new ways. Together with Red Hat, Dell and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, we will increase our ability to address real-world infrastructure needs. These partnerships give customers the flexibility to connect their existing on-premise infrastructure or Linux-based applications based applications with our cloud. 
We are leading innovation in new agile and DevOps workloads as well, with Azure app services, power apps and Visual Studio team services where we surpassed 3.8 million developer subscriptions.",".

What is the percentage of Fortune 500 companies that have at least two different Microsoft cloud offerings?
13%"
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: We are adding thousands of new developers every day who are building cloud and mobile solutions that support industries like oil and gas, finance, e-commerce, consulting, and healthcare. As we expand into new markets our revenue from premium services like security, mobility, management, and analytics nearly tripled year over year. Enterprise mobility solution customers have more than doubled year over year, and we have nearly tripled our share among Fortune 500 in the last 12 months. 
Security is now a major driver of the cloud adoption. As threats become more frequent and sophisticated, Azure's unique technologies like Machine Learning, empower customers to adapt to these new realities. This quarter we organized the Enterprise Cyber Security Group to help customers prepare for and respond to attacks.",".

Q: What is the Enterprise Cyber Security Group?
A: The Enterprise Cyber Security Group is a new division within Microsoft that helps customers prepare for and respond to attacks."
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: We unveiled plans for new data centers in Germany and the UK that address customers' data access and sovereignty needs. And we continue to release new capabilities like advanced threat analytics as part of our $1 billion product innovation and security spanning Azure, Office 365, Windows 10 and our enterprise mobility suite. 
At the heart of every business in the future will be systems of intelligence, powerful AI that helps people understand the past and predict the future. Cortana Analytics is the building block for these systems of intelligence. We released Cortana Analytics last July. It's a comprehensive suite of services that enable businesses to reason over massive quantities of data that emanate from connected people, places, and things and converts them into intelligent insights and automation.","

What is Cortana Analytics?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Coca-Cola, Russell Reynolds, and the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health System already use Cortana Analytics to dramatically change the way they market products to customers, uncover talent in the workforce and offer patients predictive and more personalized healthcare. Our goal is to make it possible for every company in every industry and every country to take advantage of this new artificial intelligence to transform. 
In the More Personal Computing segment I'm encouraged by our progress to unify our install base on Windows 10 and to create new opportunities for Microsoft and our entire ecosystem. As of this month we crossed 200 million active devices running Windows 10. Near term, in what analysts predicts will be relative flat market over this next year, we're focused on three ways to drive growth for our partners and for Microsoft.",".

What are the three ways to drive growth for Microsoft and its partners?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: First, deliver more value and innovation, particularly for enterprise customers who need advanced productivity, security, and device management. Second, grow new monetization through services across a unified Windows platform. Third, continue to innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs. 
Let me briefly expand on each. First, in November we released the first major update of Windows 10 with solutions designed to address critical business scenarios: security, manageability and ease of deployment. More than 76% of our enterprise customers are in active pilots, including organizations like Kimberly-Clark and Alaska Airlines, and 22 million enterprise and education devices are already running Windows 10. We are well-positioned to grow our commercial device footprint in the second half. 
Next, as we unify and grow the Windows 10 platform we grow new monetization opportunities with the Windows store, search, and gaming.",".

Q: What is the percentage of enterprise customers that are using Windows 10?
A: 76%"
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: This holiday season we doubled Windows store paid transactions from PC and tablets customers. This increase is an outgrowth of Windows 10 monthly active devices all up and the addition of new Windows 10 applications. This quarter Netflix, Pandora, Uber, Wall Street Journal, NPR released new apps designed to take advantage of Windows 10 experiences. For example, you can ask Cortana to recognize a song on Shazam, play a movie on Netflix or book a ride via Uber. 
With search, the clearest indicator of our progress is US  search share, where Bing now exceeds 21%. Nearly 30% of our search revenue in December came from Windows 10 devices, partly as a result of user engagement with Cortana. We are seeing increased search engagement and monetization on Windows 10 over previous versions. 
This holiday we saw record engagement on Xbox Live.",".

What is the increase in Windows store paid transactions from PC and tablets customers?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Active users grew to an all-time high of 48 million across consoles and PCs. On December 28 we had more fans using Xbox Live that any of the other day in the Xbox history. Clearly with Xbox One now upgraded to Windows 10 our vibrant community joined the Windows ecosystem. 
Our games also performed strongly this quarter. We doubled the number of Xbox One gamers playing Microsoft-published titles year over year. Minecraft concluded the holiday as the top paid app globally on Windows 10, iOS and Android. And we grew monthly active users by 18% year over year. 
Lastly, we are innovating in new device categories and driving growth. With Surface we created a new type of device, the two-in-one, and partners are now bringing similar devices to market with success.",".

What is the total number of active users on Xbox Live?

This quarter we invested $2 billion, up sequentially from the $1.5 billion invested last quarter. Other income was negative $171 million due to interest expense and net losses on derivatives, partially offset by dividend and interest income and net recognized gains on investments. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19%, in line with our expectations, with the year-over-year decrease primarily due to an IRS audit adjustment in the prior year and lower nondeductible operating losses in the current.

And we anticipate continued lessening of FX impacts by segment and on total revenue in Q4, assuming current rates stay stable. 
Second, our commercial business. We expect our commercial business to remain healthy, with ongoing shift to annuity as new and existing customers adopt and use our commercial cloud services.

Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: I just wanted to focus in on commercial cloud and Azure specifically. Commercial cloud, as you mentioned, the run rate was up $9.4 billion. That's up like $2 billion quarter to quarter, 70% year over year.  That's higher growth rate than even last quarter. Azure [similar, if not even] accelerating growth versus even last quarter. 
So a question, Satya, and I'll follow up for Amy. Satya, when you look at the growth rates there in commercial cloud, and particularly Azure, you talk about new customer wins but also existing customers transitioning more workloads into Azure.",".

What are the main drivers of Azure's growth?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: I hope you can give us maybe some more color there as far as what you're seeing and how you think about the growth going forward there? 
And then Amy, based on our calculations, it seems like Azure had a meaningful improvement in just the gross margin year over year. Wondering if you could help us with the two curves in that business, and where we are in Azure's gross margin lifecycle? Again, the fixed costs and the variable costs and how you are thinking about that? Thanks.

Thanks, Phil, for the question. The way we think about cloud is how I described it in my remarks, which is it's the combination of the work we are actually doing in the SaaS, PasS, IaaS, and also a hybrid cloud layer.",".

1. What is Azure's gross margin lifecycle?
2. How does Azure generate revenue from its cloud services?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Because we don't think, for example, of our servers as a distinct part. But it's in fact the edge of our cloud and we are building for that with things like Azure stack. We think what we have done here by bringing these things together as one architecture for distributed computing and how people will consume applications and build applications in the future, we speak to more of the real-world needs, I think, of an IT organization or a business organization that is transform through digital technology. 
If you put yourself as a CIO of a multinational organization and you want to operate in multiple geographies with different regimes for data sovereignty and then you want to be able to take some workloads, move them all to the cloud.",".

What is Microsoft's strategy for distributing workloads across its cloud?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Some you want to be able to tier with the cloud, that's the kind of flexibility we provide. And we also see network effects between if you are using Office 365, you want to extend the data in Office 365 by building applications that join it with some other data inside of our data link service in Azure, obviously Azure becomes the natural choice for such application development. And we are increasingly seeing that. That's really our strategy. Our strategy is not to complete in these constituent parts independently with different competitors. It is to bring one architecture and really drive the value for our customers because of that.

Let me quickly cover, I think, your gross margin question.",".

What is Microsoft's gross margin?

Microsoft's gross margin was 48.5% in Q2 2016."
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: You are right, we did actually make significant progress in both Azure as well as Office 365. And then the mix of those, obviously impacts the overall commercial cloud gross margin. What's important, the dynamics are actually quite similar, even though the services are quite different. There are two fundamental components to gross margin improvement. 
Number one is obviously scale efficiencies and where we are in that curve, which we are doing and continue to make consistent improvement in. The next, obviously, is the mix of premium services. Satya talked about some of the increasing mix of premium services in Azure. That has been encouraging, especially in existing customers over time and through adoption curves. And in Office 365, as you know, we continue to be excited by our premium mix in the commercial segment.",".

Question: What is the mix of premium services in Azure?
Answer: The mix of premium services in Azure includes both Office 365 and Azure services."

1. What percentage of Azure customers are using the cloud? 
2. What are some of the benefits of using the cloud for customers?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: I was hoping you could give us some color into what that looks like, specifically when an existing customers starts using Azure in terms of how does their overall spending get impacted and what happens to their spending for the more traditional server and tools? How does that get impacted as people use the public cloud utility more and more?                                          
Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO    [8]
                                        
The thing that we notice is that with anyone who has moved to the cloud there is a real opportunity for us to expand to multiple workloads over time because it's a design win. It's like essentially an ISV win in the client server area where you could get someone to build on your core infrastructure. They build their first application.",".

How does Microsoft expect Azure to impact its traditional server and tools business?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: And it turns out that you have done that, you would want to look at our infrastructure for a second workload and third workload. So that is one side of what is happening with the expansion. 
The other side of the expansion is what I also referenced, which is if you are an Office 365 customer you have data in Office 365.  You want to build applications that tap into that data, then you use Azure. That is the other piece. The EMS growth is also very much related to that, which is if you deploy Exchange online you have Azure A/D. And then the natural expansion from there is the full EMS suite with device management for all your mobile devices and also advanced threat protection and what have you.",".

Question: What is the other side of the expansion?
Answer: The other side of the expansion is what I also referenced, which is if you are an Office 365 customer you have data in Office 365."
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: We see both those trends from an application workload development synergies, as well as infrastructure from identity management, device management work out.

Good afternoon. Amy, macro is on everyone's mind. I'm curious if you guys could comment a little bit about what you are seeing. I know it may be too early to see some of the weakness that others have seen. But how are you looking at the demand environment and how does that change your plans as you look towards the back half of the year?

What assumptions does Microsoft make about the demand environment in the back half of the year?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: The geos, I specifically called out, obviously are where we are the most impacted, and they are the bigger geos. Really I think the focus that we have here is how we can best execute no matter what the macro environment turns out to be. Focus on our own execution, focus on continuing to drive cloud services, focus on continuing to drive on annuity mix. Those movements actually   and as we help customers transform, is really the best plan in the face of any uncertainty, which you are clearly asking me about. I tend to probably focus more on what we can control versus the external environment and how we can best react to that.

The thing, Heather, the move to the cloud has done for us is expanded the market opportunity that we have had more than ever before. In some sense if you compare it to the TAM of STB versus what we now describe as Intelligent Cloud, we are operating in a much bigger market. And that's because, first of all, the move to the cloud combines a whole bunch of different categories, as well as take something that you mentioned, which is Linux.  We now have the ability to take Linux workloads and run them first-class.",".

What is the TAM of STB?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: And over 20%-plus of Azure is Linux workloads, which is sort of a growth opportunity we tapped into with the cloud which we didn't have previously. 
And even take something like EMS, which is a service, you could say in the past, we participated with active directory, but we   and some amount of system center. But now with the growth of actually mobile devices and SaaS applications our opportunity with EMS is much bigger than anything that we had in the client/server era. Clearly we are migrating some workloads. And structurally some of that helps us because we had that position in the client/server space. But when we look at what we're doing in the cloud it's mostly about attaching to one of the secular growth trajectories going forward, be it open source, Linux development, mobile use and SaaS applications.",".

Thank you. Satya, Amy, congrats on the quarter. I've got for Satya and then a quick follow-up with Amy.  Satya, following up on the cloud discussion, recognizing that SaaS, PasS, infrastructure as a server hybrid, they're all related, but as Azure continues to grow fast and become a bigger part of the business, how should we think about the opportunities or the opportunity size for PasS versus infrastructure as a service?  PasS is much smaller industry-wide today, but is the opportunity is big, bigger? How should we think about that? And then a follow-up for Amy.",".

Satya Nadella, CEO: So, Mark, I think the opportunity for PasS is definitely growing. We're seeing a lot of traction in the enterprise with PasS, and we're seeing a lot of growth in the public cloud as well. So I think it's a good opportunity. The opportunity size is definitely growing. And then Amy, I think the opportunity for infrastructure as a service is also growing. We see a lot of traction in the public cloud, but we also see a lot of traction in the enterprise. So I think it's a good opportunity."

The opportunity I believe in both cases is high because it just comes in different forms. IaaS growth comes because people already have existing code that they want to move over. And then they start extending by writing more PasS because it is more efficient for them to write new code and new apps in PasS. So I think that depending what   if you are bringing something over, your IaaS will be heavy first and then PasS will grow. If you are starting new you will have Pass, which is going to be the first thing you do. But then you'll always find the need to go integrate with something that was already existing, existing data, existing code in a virtual machine.",.

I, myself, in fact one of the things that Amy and I do is when we think about our CapEx, we think about all of these layers together. In fact, we amortize our CapEx across all of these. And we pay attention to margin and premium mix because what we are comfortable   understand is customers, depending on where they start, how they start have different mix profiles. So it is the [all-up]. As long as we're growing our premium services attach and margins for those remain strong, we feel that the mix can be different and it's okay. And we really want to speak to the needs of the customers more than any product strategy goal we have.

Just a numbers question for Amy. I noticed your long-term unearned revenue was up quite a bit.

There was very strong performance on that front, very strong performance in moving customers to annuity as well as to the cloud. So aside from a bit of the lumpiness that you do note, and we have from time to time, the execution in the quarter was very strong.

The way I would think about that one, Walter, is in general our premium or enterprise workloads across Windows, SQL, system center, et cetera grew double digits. Some of that weakness, frankly, is in the non-annuity and very transactional business, which happened to impact Windows server a bit more than other workloads. That is where macro pressure on occasion shows itself first, is in some of that non-annuity lumpiness. So that's the nature of that comment.

I think there two aspects of it. We have a good operating system release for the core desktop user. And second, I believe is that we also expand out into new usage patterns.",".

What are the new usage patterns that Microsoft is expanding into?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: If you look at even the thing that we're seeing is in terms of engagement with the browser, or things like Xbox Live, with the store or new device categories like the two-in-one; all I think make it much more possible for users to engage with Windows in more mobile formats and in more productivity scenarios. So I think it's the combination of all of that. But it starts with having a good product [truth], which Windows 10 does deliver on.

Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets.                                          
Ross MacMillan,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [47]
                                        
Satya, I had a question on commercial Office 365. I don't know if you gave us the number, but I think the last couple of quarters you've talked about monthly active users.",".

Satya, can you give us a breakdown of Office 365 commercial subscribers by geography?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: And I'm curious if you have an update on that number. And then I also was curious about thoughts around ARPU because you introduced the E5 SKU in December. Where are we on the path of penetration, if you will, with the higher-value SKUs and the ability to see price list across the base over time? Thanks.                                          
Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO    [48]
                                        
Yes, [Amy, maybe you can add]. That's right. Last time we talked about the 60 million monthly active users for Office 365, and that continues to grow. In fact there is always   I think we also talked about how we get licenses sold and then all subscriptions sold.  And then there is deployment. And there's always lumpiness as well as increased deployment that happens once the users migrate.",".

Q: And then I also was curious about thoughts around ARPU because you introduced the E5 SKU in December. Where are we on the path of penetration, if you will, with the higher-value SKUs and the ability to see price list across the base over time?

A: So, we're seeing good uptake of the E5 SKU. We're seeing good uptake of the Office 365 plans. And we're seeing good uptake of the Office 365 ProPlus plans. And so we're seeing good penetration with those plans. And we're seeing good uptake of the Office 365 Education plans. And so we're seeing good penetration with those plans. And then we're seeing good uptake of the Office 365 Government plans. And so we're seeing good penetration with those plans.

And then we're seeing good uptake of the Office 365 Business plans. And so we're seeing good penetration with those plans. And then we're seeing good uptake of the Office 365 Enterprise plans. And so we're seeing good penetration with those plans."
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: And we'll continue to track that and we'll continue to disclose those numbers as they come along. But I feel very, very good in the growth of that. The best proxy for you, really, beyond any numbers we talk about in terms of monthly active is our capital. Because if you look at what we do is we spend our capital only to really fuel the growth, or to service the growth of usage across Office 365 and Azure, and you see that increasing. 
In terms of the margin profile, the entire story of having the E3 mix first to be high and now E5, that is the thing that Amy talked about, which is we now have good premium tier value in all of our products. In Office 365 that is most evident with E3 and now E5.",".

Question: What is the margin profile for Office 365?
Answer: The margin profile for Office 365 is that it has high premium tier value."
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Even in Azure we have things like EMS, we have our data services, even our developer services. I think both of our cloud products, and the major cloud products, have these premium tiers that the mix shift to those, or the addition of those is something that we are focused on and we see in our result.                                          
Amy Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - CFO    [49]
                                        
That's right. I would just add that we did see that premium mix go up in Office 365 on the commercial side, as you were noting. Really, E5 only been in market for the last month of the quarter. We are excited about the number of customers that are trying it and that all the value it offers. But I would expect that to be a longer-term evolution as opposed to in Q2.",".

Q: What do you think is driving the premium mix shift to Office 365?
A: We think it's a combination of things. One is that Office 365 has a lot of value proposition around productivity and collaboration, and we think that's resonating with customers. And then on the commercial side, we have seen that the mix shift to those higher-priced plans."

Could I just ask a quick follow-up, Amy?  That was great. Just on Windows, just so we all calibrate correctly. You've had this benefit from the RPL [columns] from last year. Should we think about Windows really now beginning to trend in line with PC units, or can there still be some variability around that? Thanks.                                          
Amy Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - CFO    [51]
                                        
In my guidance comments I talked a little bit about that. On the Pro side, as I mentioned, we will have a couple point impact that will make a difference between that on the Pro side. And I would expect, I think we actually even talked about that last quarter, that the RPL delta which we've seen in Q1 and Q2 would go away in Q3 and Q4.",".

Q: So Windows is trending in line with PC units, but there could still be some variability around that?
A: Yes, there could still be some variability around that."
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: And it would trend much more similarly to the overall consumer PC market.

Good afternoon.",". 

What is your opinion on the PC market in general and how does Microsoft stack up against its competitors?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: I wanted to ask if you have been able to quantify some of the uplift since you've been opening up Office to different platforms like iOS and Android, and now with the recent alliance with Red Hat opening a lot of opportunity to Linux developers? Have you been able to quantify how much uplift you've gotten? And how do you see this impacting your broader market opportunity?                                          
Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO    [55]
                                        
Let me speak to it in generic terms, because I don't think we have quantified it as narrowly perhaps just to address those specific moves we made.",".

1. What impact has the recent alliance with Red Hat had on Microsoft's market opportunity?
2. How do you see this impacting Microsoft's broader market opportunity?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: But overall the way we have thought about it is we want to make sure the Office subscription, both to consumers as well as to enterprise subscribers, is valuable across all their devices because it speaks to the vision that we have, which is the cloud is what enables the mobility of the human experience across all of the devices in your life. Because increasingly there will be more devices and we want to make sure that we are adding value. And if we add value in that context you would be more inclined to retain or purchase the Office subscription. That is been our goal, and that's working well.  And it is sort of shows up in our all-up growth.",".

Question: What is the goal for Office subscriptions?

Answer: The goal for Office subscriptions is to make them valuable across all of the devices in a person's life."
Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: 
Similarly with Azure, we're making sure that as people are tapping into the cloud and moving to the cloud we can get all workloads to be as first-class on Azure. So that is why we have done the deals with Red Hat. We even did previously deals with Oracle. So Azure is a complete open platform where of course you can run all the Windows workloads, dot-net workloads.  But we're increasingly seeing the open source workloads, the Linux workloads, the Oracle workloads, the SAPs and what have you. And more interestingly, a mix of all of them, because the enterprise is heterogeneous. It has been heterogeneous. We participated only in a portion of it. Whereas with Azure we can participate as the total open platform. And that is how we thought about it and that is what we are executing on.",".

Question: What are Azure's plans to support open source workloads?

Answer: Azure plans to support open source workloads by providing a complete open platform where of course you can run all the Windows workloads, dot-net workloads. But we're increasingly seeing the open source workloads, the Linux workloads, the Oracle workloads, the SAPs and what have you. And more interestingly, a mix of all of them, because the enterprise is heterogeneous."

Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. 
On the call with me today are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer and John Seethoff Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. On our website, Microsoft.com/investor, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. 
Unless otherwise specified we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.",".

Q1. What is the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures?
A. GAAP measures are used to provide a more complete understanding of our financial performance and trends. Non-GAAP measures are used to provide a more detailed understanding of our financial performance by excluding certain items from our financial statements that may not be indicative of our core operating performance."
Edited version Q4 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: They're included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the Company's fourth-quarter performance in addition to the impact of these items and events had on financial results. 
Additionally, any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our Form 10-Q, which include research and development, sales and marketing, and general administrative, but excludes the impact of integration and restructuring charges. As a reminder, in May we announced plans to further streamline the phone hardware business. During the fourth quarter, restructuring and related impairment expenses were $1.1 billion. 
All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted.","

What was the impact of restructuring and related impairment expenses of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter?
The impact of restructuring and related impairment expenses was a $1.1 billion decrease in operating income."
Edited version Q4 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. 
At the segment level, we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin. However, due to recent changes to our segment reporting groupings, we're not able to provide segment level constant currency operating expense growth and consequently cannot derive constant currency segment operating income either. 
We do provide constant currency operating expense and operating income growth at the Company-wide level. We'll post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. 
Today's call is being Webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording.",".

What is the reason for not providing constant currency operating expense and operating income growth at the segment level?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until July 19th, 2017. 
During this call we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainty. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the risk factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.                                          
Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corp. - CEO    [3]
                                        
Thank you, Chris, and to everyone on the call for joining.",".

Q: What are your thoughts on the current state of the technology industry?
A: We're seeing some really exciting things happening in the technology industry. I think it's really exciting to see the innovation that's going on, from artificial intelligence and machine learning to blockchain and virtual reality. There's a lot of potential for growth in this space."
Edited version Q4 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: 
I want to thank all the Microsoft team members and partners who contributed to a successful year. We are proud of what we achieved and particularly how we are positioned for new growth. 
Today Amy and I will share our fourth-quarter results and our perspective on the year ahead. We delivered $22.6 billion in revenue this quarter, an increase of 5% for the quarter in constant currency. This past year was a pivotal one in both our transformation and in our partnerships with customers who are also driving their own digital transformation. 
Our progress is best captured in the results of our three ambitions, starting with productivity and business process. In a world of infinite information but finite attention in time we aim to change the nature of work with digital technology.",": What is the company's ambition? 
Digital transformation"
Edited version Q4 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: In pursuit of this ambition, we continue to add value to our products, grow usage and increase our addressable market. 
Along these lines, let me start with Office 365 and then move to Dynamics 365. In the last quarter we advanced our collaboration tools. We launched Microsoft Planner which helps teams manage operations, as well as Skype meetings which is aimed at helping small businesses collaborate. 
In June, we further strengthened our security value proposition with the release of Advanced Security Management. Lastly, we continue to add intelligence and machine learning to Office to help people out automate their tasks and glean insights from data. These advancements help to drive increased usage across enterprises, small and medium businesses and consumers. 
In the enterprise, Office 365 commercial feeds grew 45% year-over-year and revenue grew 59% in constant currency.",".

What was the growth in Office 365 commercial feeds?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Also, 70% of our Office enterprise agreement renewals are in the Cloud. Innovative companies like Facebook, Hershey's, Discovery Communications, Cushman Wakefield, all adopted Office 365 and now see how transformative this service can be for their own business. 
We are enthusiastic about the early feedback and growth opportunity from companies using our newly released Office 365 E5, which includes powerful security controls, advanced analytics and Cloud Voice. These customers tell us that they love the simplification that comes with standardizing across all of our productivity workloads. We see momentum in small and medium businesses with a growing number of partners selling Office 365, now up to nearly 90,000, a 25% increase year-over-year. We continue to grab share and adding over 50,000 customers each month for 28 consecutive months.",".

Question: What percentage of Office 365 renewals are in the Cloud?
Answer: 70%"
Edited version Q4 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: 
We also see momentum amongst consumers with now more than 23 million Office 365 subscribers. Across segments, customers increasingly experience the power of Office on their iOS and Android mobile devices. In fact, we now have more than 50 million iOS and Android monthly active devices, up more than four times over last year. 
Now let's talk about progress with the other pillar of this ambition, Dynamics 365. We're removing any impedance that existed between productivity, collaboration and business process. This month we took a major step forward with the introduction of Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Microsoft AppSource. Dynamics 365 provides business users with purpose-built SaaS applications. 
These applications have intelligence built in. They integrate deeply with communications and collaboration capabilities of Office 365.",":

What is the number of Office 365 subscribers now?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Microsoft Corp Earnings Call: Dynamics 365,  along with AppSource and our rich application platform, introduces a disruptive and customer-centric business model, so customers can build what they want and use just the capabilities they need. 
The launch of Dynamics 365 builds on the momentum we're already seeing in this business. Customers around the globe are harnessing the power of Dynamics in their own transformation, including 24 Hour Fitness and AccuWeather. Overall, Dynamics now has nearly 10 million monthly paid seats, up more than 20% year-over-year and Q4 billings grew more than 20% year-over-year. 
Overall, business processes represent an enormous addressable market projected to be more than $100 billion by 2020. It's a market we're increasingly focused on and I believe we're poised with both Dynamics 365 and Microsoft AppSource to grow and drive opportunity for our partners.",".

What is the disruptive and customer-centric business model for Dynamics 365?

From a seasonality perspective, the fourth quarter is always an important one for our commercial business. Our results were strong as our sales teams led with our Cloud offers. Healthy renewals helped to drive double-digit annuity performance in constant currency. Our total annuity mix reached 83%, up 1 point year-over-year. 
While our commercial Cloud continued to drive a higher annuity mix overall, we also had better than expected transactional revenue performance, as products like Office 2016 and SQL Server 2016 generated more deal volume.
