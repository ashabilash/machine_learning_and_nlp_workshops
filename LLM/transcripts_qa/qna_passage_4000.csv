Cisco Systems, Inc. - Director of Global IR

Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call:  It shows that you were getting back to a sequential growth that is better than slightly above what you have done on average in recent years. And then, if I hear your comments, Campus was very weak in the quarter.  Routing as well.  And, you see orders coming back in routing.  My question would be whether you see something similar in Campus?  Can we expect that part of the business to improve in coming months and coming quarters?  And then, maybe just more broadly, what's your feeling about the macro today?  The uncertainty and the weakness in orders you could see three months ago, is this something that is improving now, already?

Answer: The uncertainty and the weakness in orders you could see three months ago, is this something that is improving now, already?"
Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call:  I think as it relates to our core portfolio, we have seen, obviously, some macro dynamics. Europe is clearly stressed with all the geopolitical dynamics that are occurring in Europe right now across several countries. And we also have begun to invest pretty significantly over the last year, and you'll  see it over the coming year, in ensuring we had the appropriate investments in innovation in our core.","

Question: What investments are you making in innovation to ensure your core portfolio remains competitive?

Answer: We are investing in a number of areas including our collaboration with IBM, our investment in our cloud business, and our investments in our security business."
Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call:  But, you also see what we did with AppDynamics, and what I would tell you is that when you combine the analytics that we can deliver out of the data center with the analytics that we will deliver out of the core networking space with our security threat information and analytics out of our security portfolio combined with the application analytics that they have, we believe that we can create a differentiated architecture for our customers going forward.

Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: I think just to add to that, I think, we do feel good about what we're seeing from macro in the US certainly and in commercial and enterprise. And, I would say to your point, Pierre, when you do adjust for that extra week last year, we are   our guide   we always call it like we see it, and it does show a bit of improvement there on both the top line and bottom line. So, I think like Chuck said, I think that the US is solid, and again, we're still cautious on outside the US and Europe and Asia.

Q: What are the milestones you've achieved since the partnership started?"
Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: In fact, we   obviously, there's been a lot of uncertainty on the Ericsson side, and we believe that all the original business drivers that led us to establish the partnership with Ericsson are still very valid. I think we have had some 300 customer engagements together, and their new CEO came on board just about five weeks ago, I believe. And, we have been in a great deal of discussion since then on ways in which we could accelerate the partnership.  He is committed to continuing and trying to make this as successful as we possibly can.  We're going to meet again in Barcelona at Mobile World Congress, and I would say we're focused right now on how do we accelerate from here.

Kelly, I think last quarter you quantified the impact of the shift in the business model is over 2 percentage points in terms of the hit to growth as you increase your future visibility on the shift. Can you update   I don't think I heard you give an update this quarter?

It may get even more until it evens out, but in the last few quarters, it has been in that range.

Frankly, some of them are so big they are a market of one unto themselves, and I'm very pleased with the progress we're making. If you look at those 10 just to give you the numbers this time.

And, we are trying to make that shift in the core part of the business. Cisco 1 is an example of where we are taking our ELAs and our big cross-enterprise ELAs that really are our core networking business to do that. So, we're trying to find ways to find other offers. 
I will just point to another example though like the Spark Board that Chuck mentioned. It's a great new innovation and extension of TelePresence, but it's a great example of where we are selling that   we used to sell it always as a system, now we're selling the equipment.",".

In the first four quarters, we spent time taking our teams and helping our teams understand the transition that we were going to make. So, in the first four quarters, we gained 2 points.

Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: So, we've accelerated it.  It has gone to 31% in the last two quarters. And, on the product side, that went from 6% to 7% in the first year, and then in the last two quarters, it's gone from 7% to 10%. I think we are finding ways to move that forward. 
As it relates to the core, I think you'll see us come out with services around automation and analytics and other things that will be sold as subscriptions on top of the platforms.","

Question: What are the plans for subscription-based services on top of Cisco's platforms?

1. What is the feedback loop 1 year, 1.5 years out from now in terms of does gross margin start to trend higher because of the deferred revenue mix is becoming [richer] in configuration?

The feedback loop for deferred revenue is that it becomes richer as the mix of deferred revenue increases. This is because deferred revenue is generated when a customer pays for a product or service after the fact. As the mix of deferred revenue increases, the company can earn more money from these transactions. This will cause the company's gross margin to increase."
Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: (laughter) I think our M&A strategy is going to remain intact. Repatriation doesn't fundamentally change how we think about what we're going to do going forward. You can assume that we will continue to look for opportunities to drive the business value and the relevance to our customers like we did with AppD.  They have a tremendous platform that really translates application analytics to real business performance information for our customers. 
And, just to comment on AppDynamics, they have a very robust enterprise solution that is delivered either from the cloud or on-premise and can be delivered to the customer on-premise or in the cloud. So, it's very flexible. And, they basically have 275 of the Fortune 2000, and they really have never had a substantial partner model. Those are the reasons we think that makes a lot of sense.",".

Our customers want those offers and to have an easier way to run their IT departments. It clearly enables us to get higher margins, for sure. And, it's not only just the gross margins coming out of deferred revenue, but we are looking at our whole end-to-end operations and how we go to market, how we drive operations in the back end here.

Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call:  Is this related to customer, geography?  Just a little help on understanding where the pressures are on [product gross] margin?                                           
Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [53]
                                                   Sure, I will take that one and a great question. Gross margins, we have been   again, continue to operate well. I will say there were two specific headwinds that we faced this quarter. And, to your point on APJC, I will refer back to a year ago we were benefiting from a national program in China where they were rolling out set-top boxes to tier 2 and tier 3 cities. Not our set-top boxes, but we were providing the smart cards to go with that which were   they are basically for secure access, and it was very, very high margin.",".

Q: What was the other headwind? 
A: The other headwind was the impact of the tariffs.

Kelly Kramer, Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO

Gross margins continue to operate well as we faced two specific headwinds this quarter. The first was the impact of the tariffs, which decreased our sales in the U.S. and China. The second was the impact of the APJC program, which decreased our sales in China."
Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: So, we had if you go back a year ago, SP Video in Asia was extremely strong because of that. That program has dramatically slowed down.  And, again, that pure margin just isn't there any more, and you are seeing that flow through both the margins and the year-over-year revenues for both SP Video and APJC. 
The other item that's a headwind for us this quarter is we are facing a significant cost increase to our memory costs   our DRAM memory costs that we are paying.  It's a very tight supply right now. And, we are seeing dramatic increases there. So, that's hurting us quite a bit as well. But, other than that, I would say the color is in the same line.  Our pricing is in the ranges that we have been the last six to eight quarters.","

What is the reason for the slowdown in SP Video's business in Asia?
The slowdown in SP Video's business in Asia is likely due to the slowdown in the Chinese economy."
Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call:   I'd say a little on the higher end, but in line with where we were Q3, Q4. A little worse than last quarter, but we were very low last quarter. So, in the normal ranges. It really those two specific things. I will say that I do anticipate those two headwinds to remain there next quarter as well as we had very strong SP Video   that China program in Q3 as well.

First, just had a clarification.",.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call:  There were a number of articles regarding a faulty clocking component over the last few weeks.  Just wanted to see if you could comment to what degree that is or isn't impacting customer activities?  And then, the question   I was hoping you might be able to update us in a little greater detail regarding the trends you're seeing in the service provider vertical?  You mentioned some encouraging order development?   So, was hoping you could help us understand what you are seeing across geographies?  What you are seeing from a product perspective?  And, to what degree that improvement is coming from routing optical security or some other part of the service provider business?                                           
Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [57]
                                                   Sure. I will start on the supplier component issue. So, yes, those articles are out there.",".

What is the impact on customer activities? We continue to see some impacts on customer activities, but it is difficult to quantify because it is a complex issue.

What are the trends you are seeing in the service provider vertical? We are seeing some encouraging order development in the service provider vertical."
Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: We have had an issue from a supplier come out. And, we did book a reserve for $125 million you can see in our GAAP results and in the press release to cover that. We always and continue to stand by our customers through any situations like this.  This is very proactive. This is a failure rate that will happen over time, but we are working with our customers to work through that so we're not anticipating any impact from that from a top line perspective.                                          
Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [58]
                                                   I will take the SP portion, Kelly. So, Jess, on the service provider space, it's really similar to last time. We talked about SP CapEx   different service providers are looking at different areas of investment depending on what's going on in their network.",".

What is Cisco's plan for service provider investments in the near future?"
Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call:  So, you have some who are looking at macro radio densification as an example, and others are looking at building out capacity in the quarter. And so, we have   and it's a segment that is very dominated by large customers. 
So, from a quarter-to-quarter basis, any number of customers that make any shift in their buying behavior can have an impact either positively or negatively.  It's a space that I will just encourage you to look at longer term, but we did see   we saw a definite improvement. We saw   I would say from a regional perspective what I would tell you is the Americas was very strong.  And, we saw general weakness in Europe and then the China space you had a lot of this SP Video implication that Kelly was talking about earlier.",".

Question: What impact did the shift in buying behavior by certain customers have on Cisco's macro radio densification segment in the quarter?

I feel good about where they are right now.

What is the company's rationale for the deferred revenue growth?"
Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: Looking at the balance sheet, it looks like it rose year-over-year by about $1.9 billion, and you talked about the total of software and recurring revenue at $4 billion. Could you help us get a better understanding of what are the components?  And, I'm presuming there are some elements that maybe are growing much slower, some growing faster.  So, help us understand what are the big drivers for that 51% growth. Thank you.                                          
Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [62]
                                                   Sure. So, that 51% growth is year-over-year growth of over $1.3 billion. And, everything is growing in that space. I would say from a pure size, collaboration and security and Meraki are the biggest pieces of that because they have just continued to grow their businesses significantly, and they are all growing huge double digits.",".

What are the biggest drivers for Cisco Systems' 51% growth in 2017? The biggest drivers for Cisco Systems' 51% growth in 2017 were the continued growth of its collaboration and security and Meraki businesses."
Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: But, I will also say my switching and my routing as well as data center, we've done fiscal one bundles as well as big enterprise license agreements.  They've also been growing huge double digits as well. So, at the end of the day, the year-over-year increases across the board, everything is up massively to drive to that 51%.  And, again, just the biggest chunk of it between collaboration, security, and wireless, they are two-thirds I would say of the balance but the other pieces   .

We did deliver strong innovation, I believe, which was reflective in the performance that we've had in security collaboration, next-gen data center, and we continue to drive innovation in our core enterprise and SP portfolio. The deferred revenue from our subscription and software business is indicative, I think, of the transition that you should continue to expect from us. We will continue to focus on driving profitable growth with productivity and operational efficiencies, and you also can count on the fact that we remain very committed to our shareholder return as was indicated in both our buybacks and our dividend, and then, the increase in the dividend this quarter.",".

                                                   I wanted to see if we could understand more of the guidance, Kelly and Chuck. The revenues are little lighter than we had anticipated. Is that a function of macro factors? Or is that a function more of the shift to the subscription model or maybe there's going to be some disturbance here and there. Clearly, the deferred revenue   product revenue growth is quite nice, but I was just wondering if there's any sort of puts and takes you could walk us through there.

Edited version Q3 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: So Mark, when we look at guidance, it's a combination of many factors, right? It starts with our backlog and then orders on them, the funnel. And then yes, definitely, we take into account our transition to more software and subscriptions and how that's impacting it. So when I look at the guidance we just gave, our orders were a little weaker in Q3, which does mean that I'm starting with the lower backlog than anticipated. And then when I'm assuming, when I look at the order strength, we're assuming what we saw in Q3 continues on in Q4. So just to give some color around that. Where we had   we have been facing headwinds all quarter long with SP and emerging. We saw them get worse this quarter that you saw in the numbers there.",".

What is the impact of the headwinds on orders?

So I'm assuming that orders in line that we saw in Q3 is going to continue on in Q4. And then finally, we are seeing an impact because you're seeing it go to the balance sheet of this transition that we are just accelerating through to the tune of 1.5 to 2 points. So the combination of those 3 things are driving the guidance into that minus-4 to minus-6 range.

It's a pretty significant stall right now with the lack of budget visibility. And when you think about the strategy that we're deploying, the 57% growth in the software and subscription business, if you just go back 8 quarters ago, we had $2 billion on our balance sheet relative to software and subscription.

And now we have more than doubled that to $4.4 billion, and the growth there is accelerating. So we are very pleased with that transition.",".

Question: What is the outlook for the Public Sector business?

                                                   So Ittai, when we look at the drivers of our growth margin, price in Q3 actually has been in the same range that it was pretty much last year as well as last quarter in terms of the price index that we're seeing. So that's in the same range. Again, it's high, but it's in the range. It's not increasing. I would say in terms of the guidance for Q4, we're assuming that. We are also making sure the teams are being very aggressive where they need to be aggressive in areas and then against competitors where we need to be. But overall, the pricing hasn't changed dramatically besides the normal erosion that we see in churned business lines.",".

Question: So it sounds like you're seeing pricing stability in terms of the index, but you're expecting a higher churned business line in Q4?

Answer: Yes, we're expecting a higher churned business line in Q4."
Edited version Q3 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: I'd say, in terms of mix, that hasn't dramatically changed as well, with switching being positive this quarter, that helped a lot. And again, well, the mix isn't changing. There's mix changes with [MBEs] in the guidance going forward but it's nothing dramatic. So I'd say we feel good about being able to continue driving the margins that we have. The only other piece I'll comment on, because we mentioned it before, we are still seeing some cost pressure from the increase in DRAM pricing that was got baked in both our Q3 as well as into Q4. But we've been doing a lot of work, and our supply chain team has done working with our suppliers to make sure we can secure our forward supply at prices that we can plan on.","

Can you talk a little bit about the orders and you mentioned that fed was weak. But when you look at the other areas of weakness, can you talk about, like, what's driving those, et cetera? And I guess, more long term, it continues to be a good deferred revenue growth, and you mentioned the security.",".

Regarding orders, we continue to see good demand from our customers across a wide range of industries. We continue to see good demand from our enterprise customers, and we continue to see good demand from our service provider customers. We continue to see good demand from our retail customers. We continue to see good demand from our government customers. And we continue to see good demand from our carrier customers.

Regarding the weakness in fed, we continue to see weakness in the U.S. dollar. And we continue to see weakness in global economic conditions. And we continue to see weakness in the global technology sector.

So if we just go around   sort of go around the globe, let me just highlight what we saw. And I'm just going to tell you what drove the weakness in these areas so you can assume the other pieces of the business were pretty much as expected. In the Americas, it was primarily the U.S.",". 1. What was the main driver of weakness in the Americas? 
2. What are you doing to address that weakness?"
Edited version Q3 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: federal   I mean, there's so much uncertainty around budgets. The U.S. federal business was a significant driver. Mexico, there has been a lot of uncertainty in Mexico, and that was actually down 49% for us year-over-year. So it was   there's a great deal of uncertainty around the investment landscape there. And then the third element would have been the Service Provider business in the Americas. So those were the things that really drove the orders in the U.S. In Europe, the U.K., the currency issue in the U.K. is real and was very impactful in that business. And then we continue to see pressure in the Middle East relative to oil prices. We also   obviously, there's been a lot of uncertainty around the geopolitical dynamics, some of which have been clarified recently, obviously.","

And the Middle East, obviously, with the uncertainty around oil prices, continues to be a little bit of a pressure as well. In APJC, we saw Japan and Australia were reasonable. India was solid again. And China, we had tough comps from the SP Video business from a year ago that we talked about. So that's really what we saw from an orders perspective. I think if you look at customer segments, just to give you some color, Enterprise, the challenge was largely driven by Europe. Commercial, the lightness there was driven by Europe. Public Sector, as I said, was U.S. Federal, and SP was fairly consistent. So Kelly, any other comments on that?

They're looking for an open architecture that actually allows them to buy the best-of-breed technology, which we have across many elements of what they're trying to do. But they are looking for an architecture, and they're looking for   to leverage as much of that from the cloud, and which correspondingly turns into the subscription business, as you pointed out.

I guess, the broader question is how important is getting this company back to growth? It looks like last year, you did grow. This year, you're probably not going to grow very much, i.e. especially organically. So is there something more transformative have to happen on the M&A front?

Maybe help us understand how much of that is SMARTnet and maintenance-type services and how much is, let's call it, next-gen recurring revenue. And so that   and I also would like it, if you could comment, I know the carrier situation in the U.S. is pretty weak, and we've seen that across other companies as well. But could you comment on specific projects like the Metro Optical buildout? Is that still a bright spot? Do you still see that project moving ahead as expected?

So yes, if I break out the 31%, so the way to think about it, Rod, is basically, 90% of my services revenue is recurring, okay? So of the 31%, 75% of that dollar amount, so the $3.6 billion   over $3.6 billion, 75% of that comes from the Services business. On the product side, 10% of my product revenue is now coming from recurring, so that's over $900 million. So 25% of that over $3.6 billion. And so again, I think that Services has continued to be in that 90% range. And again, what we're really trying to drive is more and more of those offers on the product side.

On your second question, we absolutely continue to see the projects like Metro Optical moving forward. We've actually continued to do well in some of the next-generation areas that we're working with many of the U.S. service providers.

And I'm trying to see what could cause reacceleration. The question I have is whether you focus the recurring part mostly on new types of businesses, such as security and others, or you can find ways to go back to Switching and Routing and change either pricing scheme or add features or do something such that recurring revenues outside of maintenance, of course, recurring revenues grow, and you can add software features on top will do that.

Probably 18 months ago, we started that journey and we got those offers and they began to ramp. But we also are looking   obviously, security is ramping. Collaboration has been the one probably the longest in this model. But we do believe that across the portfolio, with future offers, we have the opportunity to do that, and you'll see that as we deliver on some of the new capabilities.

In Q1, we delivered a solid quarter with revenue of $12.1 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.61. We are seeing great traction with our new intent-based networking solutions, delivering accelerated innovation across our portfolio and offering a broader range of new consumption options to our customers, resulting in strong increases in our software and subscription revenue.",".

$12.1 billion"
Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: The progress we've made resulted in all 3 of our geographic regions returning to orders growth during Q1. 
Cisco has always been about connecting people, information and machines at scale. Today, the network is becoming more pervasive and critical to business success as billions of new connections are added. We expect these new connections will become increasingly automated, intelligent and secure, delivering unprecedented insights and intelligence to our customers.
Cisco's vision is to deliver highly secure, intuitive technology across our portfolio that is designed to constantly learn, adapt and protect to drive business outcomes with greater speed and agility. This extends to the network, next-generation data center architectures, advanced IoT applications, end-to-end analytics and our collaboration technologies.",".

What is Cisco's vision for the network?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: Our vision is resonating with customers and partners around the world as we help them build more secure, intelligent platforms for their digital businesses. 
Today, most of our customers are operating in complex, multi-cloud environments, and Cisco is well-positioned to provide them with networking capabilities, enterprise-class security and support, together with cloud scale, agility and economics. Our new partnership with Google is a good example of this. Over the last few months, our engineering teams have been working closely together to jointly develop a new hybrid cloud solution that is designed to enable applications and services to be deployed, managed and secured across on-premise environments as well as the Google Cloud Platform, bringing the best of cloud to the enterprise. 
This partnership is an example of the work we are doing with all of the large web scale providers.",".

What is the new hybrid cloud solution that Cisco and Google are working on?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: We are also investing to develop and acquire new technologies to extend our multi-cloud portfolio. This includes ACI Anywhere, which we announced this quarter; and acquisitions such as CliQr, OpenDNS, CloudLock, AppDynamics and Viptela. 
Now I'd like to cover some key business highlights in our new product reporting categories. First, let's start with Infrastructure Platforms. Our launch of the network intuitive in June is an example of the investment and innovation we're driving in our core business. These new intent-based networking capabilities are providing customers unparalleled insights and intelligence, together with highly differentiated security and programmability. 
Our new subscription-based Catalyst 9000 Switching platform has been adopted by more than 1,100 customers in just over 3 months.","

What is the new Catalyst 9000 Switching platform?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: We expect continued momentum throughout fiscal 2018, and we're pleased that the vast majority of Catalyst 9000 customers are buying our most advanced software subscription offer. 
Additionally, we saw good performance in our next-generation data center switching platforms, as customers continue to shift to 10-gig, 40-gig and 100-gig architectures and embrace multi-cloud adoption. We continue to advance our intent-based networking for data center and private cloud environments with the latest software release of ACI. Over 4,000 ACI customers are benefiting from increased business agility with network automation, simplified management and improved security. 
Going forward, we see a tremendous opportunity to benefit from a shift in customer demand from standalone products to integrated platforms with our intent-based infrastructure portfolio providing unmatched benefits. 
Now turning to Applications. Applications are absolutely essential to every digital business strategy.",".

What is the most important trend in customer demand for Cisco's applications?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: To maximize their effectiveness, companies require a highly secure network that closely monitors applications and workload performance across a complex multi-cloud environment. Our acquisition of AppDynamics is core to our capability of providing end-to-end analytics from the network to the data center to the application.
Within our Applications business, we are enabling new capabilities based on advanced AI and machine learning across our portfolio. An example of this is our acquisition of Perspica, providing deep machine learning, driven analytics to further extend AppDynamics' leading capabilities in application intelligence. Additionally, we announced our latest innovation on the Cisco Spark platform, Spark Assistant, which is the world's first enterprise-ready, AI-powered voice assistant to further enhance our customers' meeting experience. 
Our intended acquisition of BroadSoft will enhance our subscription and cloud-based business.",".

What is the intended acquisition of BroadSoft?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: BroadSoft has 19 million subscribers in the growing cloud voice and contact center space and will enable Cisco to offer an even broader portfolio of collaboration solutions to our customers, on-premise and in the cloud. We expect this acquisition to accelerate the pace of innovation in our collaboration business, and we see many opportunities to extend the reach of the BroadSoft portfolio. 
Moving to Security. With an expanding threat landscape, cybersecurity is the #1 priority for businesses worldwide and is at the heart of every company's digital strategy. In a multi-cloud world, as our customers' environments become increasingly distributed, security requirements only increase. At Cisco, security continues to be a strategic imperative and fundamental to everything we do. 
As customers adopt and advance intent-based networking, our end-to-end security is the foundation to keep our customers protected from advanced threats.",".

What is the #1 priority for businesses worldwide and at the heart of every company's digital strategy?"

To summarize, we delivered a solid quarter as we continue to execute well against our strategic priorities. I firmly believe that Cisco is well positioned to capture long-term growth opportunities ahead.",".

What is the 8% revenue growth in Cisco's Security portfolio?

What was the main reason for the revenue decline in Q2?

The rule of enterprise IT is dramatically changing with the move to an application-centric focus and adoption of hybrid cloud architectures, with customers increasingly seeing the value of integrated platforms over standalone products. Cisco's intent-driven architecture with a focus on simplicity, automation and security allows enterprises to manage and govern the interactions of users, devices and applications across the environment.

So let me give you a little bit more detail on our Q1 revenue.

Deferred product revenue from our recurring software and subscription offers was up 37% to $5.2 billion.",".

Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: We continue to be negatively impacted by higher memory pricing, like we've discussed over the past several calls, which we expect to continue in the near term. 
Our operating margin was 30.4%, down 1.2 points. 
When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our results year-over-year, there has been a 60 basis point positive impact on revenue, no impact on gross margin, a 3-point increase on non-GAAP operating expenses, all resulting in a negative 70 basis points impact on our non-GAAP operating margin rate and a negative $0.01 year-over-year impact on our GAAP EPS. 
In terms of the bottom line, our Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $0.61, while GAAP EPS was $0.48.

To summarize, in Q1, we continued to make progress on our strategic growth priorities while maintaining rigorous discipline on profitability and cash generation. We continue to prioritize our key investments to drive long-term profitable growth. 
Let me reiterate our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year '18. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. And also, as Chuck mentioned, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire BroadSoft.",".

Answer: The growth in operating cash flow was 13%."
Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: The acquisition is expected to close after completion of the customary regulatory reviews, and therefore, it is not included in the guidance.
We expect revenue growth in the range of 1% to 3% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 62.5% to 63.5%. And the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30.5%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%.

Questions and Answers
                                        
Operator    [1]
                                                   Our first question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.                                         
Pierre C. Ferragu,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Former Senior Analyst    [2]
                                                   Kelly, I can't help asking you an update on gross margin movements. So can you give us a bit of a sense of how big is memory prices in the 1.5 points gross margin declines that you've seen year-on-year? And then sequentially, your guide for gross margin in   for Q2 was slightly below what you've been guiding for Q1. Is there still like incremental headwind coming from compound pricing hurting you from the Q1 to Q2?                                         
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [3]
                                                   Yes. Thanks, Pierre. Great question.",".

Q: What is the memory price decline impacting Cisco's gross margin?
A: The memory price decline is impacting Cisco's gross margin negatively."
Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: Yes, so the vast majority of the impact on our gross margin is driven by memory. It is basically 1.3 points of my product gross margin decline year-over-year. Everything else in our gross margin is basically in the normal ranges. So we expect that to continue. When you look at the guidance, we did bring it down 0.5 point to account for that because we are still seeing increases as we look forward   moving forward. But otherwise, we kind of see everything else in the normal range of things.                                         
Operator    [4]
                                                   Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays Capital.                                         
Mark Alan Moskowitz,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Former Director    [5]
                                                   Chuck, you talked about 1,100 customers have already adopted the intuitive network.",".

What is the average revenue per customer that has adopted the intuitive network?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: I just want to get a sense in terms of how does that underpin, longer term, the steady-state growth? You guys guided to about 1% to 3% growth for the current quarter. But as more and more of those customers adopt and they move beyond the labs and move beyond the proof-of-concept, can we actually see your growth tick higher than 1% to 3% on a steady-state?                                         
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [6]
                                                   Yes, Mark. Thanks for the question. So clearly, we're pleased with where we're going right now with this product portfolio. We're pleased with the early feedback. I'll tell you that our sales teams, our partners and our customers, are very excited about the architecture that we've announced.",".

Question: What are the key drivers of growth in the current quarter?
Answer: The key drivers of growth in the current quarter are the early feedback from our customers and partners."
Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: It's still one quarter, so we have to get a little more time under our belt. 
But what I will tell you is that when we look back at a transition like the 3850 years and years ago, it's very much in line. And I think that as more customers have the opportunity to test the automation and programmability and all those software features that they're testing right now, we would hope that the platform continues to accelerate.

                                                   To continue along those lines, Chuck, you talked a little bit about the software attach rates.",".

What is the attach rate for software on the 3850?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: Could you elaborate on that? And particularly the advantage premium, which, I think, has the encryption capability and so forth? Exactly what sort of mix are you seeing? And do you think that customers are going to be willing to pay up for the premium?

                                                   Well, thanks, Steve. So what I said in the script is that a vast majority of our customers that are buying these platforms are opting for the advanced. And I would say that it's a vast majority. We knew when we introduced a subscription on a switch that we needed to ensure that there was unique innovation that was available to our customers in order for them to see value in that.","

What is the advantage premium?
The advantage premium is a subscription-based offering that includes unique innovation and enhanced capabilities for our customers."
Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: 
We couldn't just simply shift the capabilities that they had gotten before in a perpetual model. We needed to drive new innovation. So the anchors that are in that advanced subscription are the overall automation capability, which really gets at the OpEx of running these networks; and the second part is the Encrypted Traffic Analytics, where we can determine when there's malware inside encrypted traffic without decrypting it. 
And we think that those 2 are phenomenal incremental capabilities that our customers didn't have before, and I think that's why we're seeing such a high attach rate. So we're very pleased with where we are on that as well.

And the reason I ask is we are starting to see this positive news flow, Alibaba cloud recently and, perhaps here in Microsoft as well. 
What has changed in your view, Chuck, in terms of the sales motion? Is it the clouds paying attention to things like software automation tools, security? Anything else? Or is it just a sales focus on cloud? Help us understand.

But if you look at whether it's the announcements we've made with Microsoft a couple of quarters ago, the announcement we made with Google, you alluded to Alibaba, which there's a summary of that win on our website, if you want to go see that.

And as I think about that, we're a very natural   we're the very natural partner for them to partner with as the network is the only common denominator across all these cloud environments all the way out to the edge of our enterprise customers' networks.",".

But maybe you can help us understand where you stand on that product line, how good you feel about the platform, how stable it is.

But what the customers are doing right now is they're basically becoming accustomed to the platform. They're testing the platform before they make an investment on any sort of backwards compatibility is what I would tell you.

                                                   I wanted to ask a question on capital structure. Can you give us an idea of what your preference is and priorities will be in capital structure in terms of buybacks and acquisitions, et cetera, if the proposed new tax changes pass versus if that change in tax law gets derailed? I'm particularly curious as to how you're thinking about the pacing of acquisitions versus buybacks, et cetera.                                         
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [35]
                                                   Yes, I'll take that one. What I'd say is in terms of acquisitions, the tax policy isn't impacting us either way because we are lucky to have a great cash flow and access to capital.",".

What is Cisco's preference for buybacks and acquisitions?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: So it hasn't been stopping us from anything from an acquisition perspective, and it won't. So that will continue. I would say we're definitely encouraged by the progress that's going on in the tax reform. 
So like  we said in the past, when that happens and if we get a repatriation, which most plans currently have, we're going to continue, like we have, growing our dividend with our earnings growth. And where we have opportunity is really to get much more aggressive than we have been on the share buyback. And of course, we want to make sure we continue to have enough firepower to continue to able to do the right acquisitions to help us position Cisco right for the long term.

Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: I'd say, it's a combination of things, right? I mean, if I go to the amount of revenue coming off the balance sheet from the progress we've been steadily making on growing our software and subscriptions, it's now up to 12% of our product revenue is now coming from recurring offers and off the balance sheet. So that's helping. 
I would say also, the launch that we had on the intuitive network and the excitement around the reinvention of the core is having an impact. So we're encouraged. And you heard me mention, we're seeing positive demand on [man or wan] Campus Switching overall, which is great, and that has a big impact because it's one of the biggest pieces of our portfolio.","

                                                   James, just to clarify one point or just to add to it, actually, when Kelly says 12% of our product revenue is coming from recurring offers, just to put that in perspective, when I became CEO, it was 6%.

And we've seen a little bit more out of Huawei perhaps, not in the U.S., of course, but international. I'm wondering if you could put some of that color into context for us, both from them and also from some of your traditional rivals.

                                                   So thanks for the question, Jeff. I think that if you look at some of the performance we saw around the world, to your point, in Europe and Asia, we've talked about Huawei's activity over the last couple of quarters. I would say that our teams have been very focused on it. I think that the intuitive network launch that we did in June really changes the discussion.",".

What was the ""intuitive network launch"" that Cisco Systems, Inc. did in June?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: 
And where we compete with competitors who their value prop is upfront cost of the hardware, I think we're changing the discussion, because if you look at the cost of operating this infrastructure over a 5-year period, it's probably 10x the cost of the upfront hardware. 
So going and helping our customers really reduced that is a value proposition that helps us change the discussion relative to the competition. So they continue to be very tough, but we think that competing on the price of the box upfront is something that we can shift over the next couple of years.

A: I don't think it's a shift to subscription. I think it's more that we're seeing more orders coming in. The subscription model is really starting to take off. It's been growing at a pretty good clip. And then there's also been strength in the orders that Chuck mentioned."

But I'm still putting more and more offers. And as we get scale through the core networking, not just on Switching but the whole DNA Center, I think that'll continue to add. 
So it's still going to be a headwind. And as I said before, this 1.5 to 2 points will move to more like a 2 to 3 points in the upcoming years as we get more scale there.

Our largest enterprise customers, which the way we define it, is really just an organizational segment that we have, we did see   we saw negative mid-single digits there, which you saw on the slides. 
In our commercial business, we saw 12% growth on a global basis, and it was double digits in every geography, which is always good to see.

Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [3]
                                                   Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a very strong finish to a great year. We generated our highest quarterly revenue of $12.8 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.70, as growth accelerated for another consecutive quarter.
Our momentum was broad-based across our portfolio, customer segments and geographies. We also continued to generate solid margins, cash flow and returns for our shareholders. Our results demonstrate a combination of strong customer adoption of our latest innovations, the ongoing value customers see in our software and subscription offerings and excellent execution across our customer segments and geographies.",".

Question: What was the highest quarterly revenue of $12.8 billion?
Answer: The highest quarterly revenue of $12.8 billion was generated in the fourth quarter of 2018."
Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: Our strategy is working, and we believe that we are well-positioned to capture growth across the portfolio with our pipeline of innovation.
The broad adoption of multi-cloud environments is changing the very nature of how modern IT infrastructures are built and secured, and Cisco is at the center of this transition. The recently announced intent to acquire Duo Security is another example of how we are extending our intent-based networking portfolio for the multi-cloud world. Duo's SaaS-delivered solution will expand our cloud security capabilities to help enable any user on any device to securely connect to any application on any network. Combining Cisco's network, endpoint and cloud security platform with Duo's zero-trust authentication and access solutions, we will be able to further enhance the industry's broadest and most effective security architecture in the market.",".

What is the intent-based networking portfolio for the multi-cloud world?"
Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: 
Now I'll briefly highlight some of our innovation and the great momentum we're seeing across our key product areas.
Starting with Infrastructure Platforms. We continue to rapidly innovate and transform our technology portfolio to drive even greater customer value. A year ago, we reinvented Enterprise Networking with the launch of our intent-based networking architecture. This quarter, we saw continued strength in Infrastructure Platforms, driven by the Catalyst 9000, as customers look to us to simplify and automate their networks. Over the last year, we introduced additional innovations across our networking portfolio, including new access, WAN and data center offerings. In June, we announced new developer capabilities across our intent-based networking portfolio, spanning all network domains: Campus switching, wireless, WAN, data center and cloud.
We're also excited that our developer program, DevNet, surpassed 500,000 registered members.",".

What is the Catalyst 9000?
The Catalyst 9000 is a new generation of Cisco's Enterprise Networking platform that simplifies and automates networks."
Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: As part of this program, we introduced new offerings to help developers and network engineers innovate throughout our intent-based architecture. 
As we all know, the WAN is undergoing an architectural transition to a software-defined WAN to enable IT to rapidly respond to changing business needs in a digital and cloud world. Our customers are driving this transition and looking to Cisco to help them make this shift. Our SD-WAN portfolio leverages our leading networking products, automation and robust security architecture to enable greater flexibility, increased bandwidth and lower costs. This quarter, we saw significant traction with Viptela, as it has now been deployed at over 800 customers, driven by our ability to provide higher capacity at a lower cost.",".

What is the Viptela deployment at 800 customers?"
Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: We are pleased with the ongoing integration of Viptela with our core portfolio to drive even more value for our customers.
As our customers move to a multi-cloud environment, we see tremendous opportunities to provide value to them by redesigning their IT architecture, delivering security and building, orchestrating and managing applications. In Q4, we saw the production launch of our hybrid cloud solution with Google, the introduction of a multi-cloud solution with NetApp and numerous engagements with customers redesigning their IT architectures. We continue to believe Cisco is very well-positioned to benefit from the increasing adoption of multi-cloud.
Turning to security. Security continues to be our customers' #1 concern and it is a top priority for us.",".

What is your strategy for addressing customer concerns around security?"
Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: Our strategy is to simplify and increase security efficacy through an architectural approach, with products that work together and share analytics and actionable threat intelligence. This architecture is supported by Talos, one of the largest commercial threat intelligence teams in the world. We identify and protect against new and emerging threats, like the recent VPN filter vulnerability, through our sophisticated infrastructure and unrivaled telemetry of data. 
Cisco is the largest network and enterprise security company, and our approach of bringing security into the intent-based architecture and offering security across the network, endpoint and cloud has proven to be very successful. This quarter, we saw continued strong momentum with revenue again accelerating and growing double digits year-over-year.
We continue to invest in our product and technology innovation as we are committed to helping our customers on their multi-cloud journey.",".

What is the company's strategy to simplify and increase security efficacy through an architectural approach?"
Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: Our focus is on delivering cloud security solutions that provide ease-of-use, scalability and protect end users. As I mentioned earlier, with our acquisition of Duo Security, we will further enhance how we deliver simple, automated, trusted access anywhere for our customers' environments.
Moving to applications. In May, we announced the launch of WebEx Teams, bringing together meetings, calling and teamwork into an integrated experience as part of the WebEx platform. In Q4, we introduced major new enhancements to the platform, including a new user design for WebEx Meetings and a new solution with Google, combining their contact center AI service with the WebEx platform.","

What was the announcement in May that Cisco made about WebEx Teams?"
Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: With more than 3 million customer service agents globally using Cisco's contact center software, our integration with Google will help to automate responses in our call centers by leveraging data and intelligence from AI.
We also achieved another robust quarter of growth with AppDynamics, underscoring the importance and value of our unique end-to-end visibility and analytics from the end user to the network to the application.
To wrap up, 2018 was a great year. We returned to growth, invested in our core franchises, delivered new innovative platforms and continued to shift our business to more software and subscriptions. Our record results demonstrate the strength of our business as well as the strategic focus and execution that we have delivered over the past 12 months.",".

What is the significance of Cisco's integration with Google?

The integration will help to automate responses in Cisco's call centers by leveraging data and intelligence from AI."
Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: I want to thank our teams around the globe for delivering these results.

Product gross margin for the Americas and EMEA were both up year-over-year.
Overall, pricing continued to have relatively modest erosion, as we have seen over the past couple of quarters, and we continue to be negatively impacted by higher component costs, which we expect to continue in the near term.

The normalized free cash flow for the fiscal year was $17.7 billion."
Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: Its primary impact will be to accelerate our revenue recognition for certain software licenses and sales to 2-tier distributors as well as the recognition of a deferred commissions asset that will be amortized over the terms of our sales contracts.
Let me reiterate our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year '19. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7% year-over-year. This range includes the impact of ASC 606, which we estimate to be a benefit of about 1%. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 30% to 31%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%.",".

Question: What is the impact of ASC 606 on Cisco's guidance?

                                                   So my question to you, Chuck, and Kelly, please chime in, is it reasonable to assume you'd be extending the software subscription idea and plan across the portfolio? Give us an early glimpse as to how is it going? What are some of the challenges? What are some of the positive surprises? And would the makeup of the software subscription portfolio meaningfully change as you look to extend this model across the portfolio?                                         
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [3]
                                                   Thanks, Vijay. So most of you know that we   when we began the sell of the Catalyst 9000, that was the first attempt to sell a subscription software offering on top of a core networking product.",. Question: What were some of the challenges in selling the subscription software offering? Answer: The challenge was that we had to convince customers to pay for a service that they didn't need. We also had to convince them that the service was worth the price.
Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: And that has gone, as we've said on prior calls, reasonably well. I'm very pleased with how the adoption has been from our customers. They understand the value. As I said early on, we put   we knew when we started that process that we would need to deliver significant innovation that wasn't available in the traditional methodology of buying it in order for our customers to adopt it. And some of those were the Encrypted Traffic Analytics, the overarching analytic   I mean, the automation capability and then recently, some Assurance. And you'll see us over the next coming quarters, when we bring new products to market in the   particularly in the enterprise networking space, but across the portfolio, we will apply that same strategy. So I think that we've been pleased.","

Q: And what are the key areas of innovation that you're expecting to bring to market in the next quarters?

A: You'll see us bring new products to market in the enterprise networking space, but across the portfolio, we will apply that same strategy. So I think that we've been pleased."
Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: And our job now is to ensure that the operational infrastructure of the company is prepared, and we're working towards being able to ensure that customers are deriving the value from that software as well as obviously putting in the operational capabilities to ensure the renewals, et cetera. So that's what we're focused on. Kelly, any...?

 deferred revenue was up 28% year-over-year in Q4 2018, including an increase of $1.2 billion from our off-balance sheet deferred revenue. We attribute this growth to the continued success of our products and services, as well as our strong execution across our business."
Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: Is that total deferred or product deferred? Can you just clarify what you meant by that? And also, maybe help us understand what that ASC 606 impact on deferred was because that was, I guess, negative?                                         
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [7]
                                                   Yes, sure. So on your question on the deferred revenue plus unbilled deferred, so that was up 28%. The big driver we have for that, that is just purely product, okay? So it is   what we mostly have in our unbilled deferred is from our collaboration, our Applications business. They have a lot of periodic billing that they book month-to-month. That is a very large number. So it is kind of apples-to-apples of business that we have booked that we will recognize in the future. So that's why we look at both.",".

But it is just product, that 28%. As far as the ASC 606, we adopt that in Q1. So in the results we just went through, of the $6.1 billion of deferred from software and subscriptions, that is related to how we've been accounting for it under the old ASC 605.

What will be the effect on Cisco's earnings in Q1 of adopting ASC 606?
The effect on Cisco's earnings in Q1 of adopting ASC 606 will be to defer $6.1 billion of software and subscription revenue, which is related to how Cisco has been accounting for it under the old ASC 605."
Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: So yes, I can give you some direction. You'll see that in our K. So we will be writing off a portion of that balance. So of the $6 billion, we will be writing off and restating because you basically restate your balance sheet for the new accounting rules. And like we've said over the past year, where we will have that impact is things that were term-based software licenses, things like our ELAs or Cisco ONE, those will now be recognized upfront where they used to be deferred. So the deferred revenue balance will be written down for that, and we'll take   so we'll take   we'll lower the balance of the deferred revenue. And then as we go into Q1, we will be recognizing any new business that we bill upfront from that.

Globally, you seem to be moving along, sidestepping all of those things. Which of these things really bother you, concern you or you're watchful, you're preparing for?

I have said publicly, I think we're operating in a   we have been operating in, what I would call, it's been a very consistent global economic scenario. There's clearly, even in the last few weeks, been things that have arisen. You've got the strengthening of the dollar that you mentioned. You've got some uncertainty in a couple of emerging countries. So those are clearly things that we'll watch. And we're   we've seen these in the past, and we know how to deal with them.",".

Q1. What are the main factors that have influenced Cisco's financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2018?
A. The main factors that have influenced Cisco's financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2018 include the strengthening of the dollar, some uncertainty in a couple of emerging countries, and the continued growth of the global economy."
Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: We obviously have the impending tariff situation, which we're watching closely.

But overall, all of those are things that we are very actively involved with and we watch on a daily basis. As it relates to the networking business, the Catalyst 9000, as I said previously, has been the fastest-ramping product that we've ever built. So the customer count became less of an indicator pretty quickly, and it flowed through to the infrastructure systems growth that you saw this quarter.","

And I think you mentioned as well that your routing business was weak, and most of that weakness was in the service provider vertical as well. So I was curious to understand how you grew revenues, if   even if routing was negative or maybe I got something wrong? And then, of course, I'm very curious to hear whether this recovering service provider spending might be driven by 5G already.

So Pierre, the   in the service provider space, we were obviously pleased. I've said a number of times over the last couple of years that this is a business that is dominated by large customers. And so as we've always said, when we have several of them that are slowing their spending, then it looks bad; when we have several that are spending, it looks pretty good. And that's just the nature of this business. Relative to 5G, I will tell you that   I think I've said this on prior calls.",".

So I would say that   I would not say that this is a material result of the implementation of 5G, to be honest. We expect that is still a year out before many will start and probably see it in earnest into 2020, to be fair. But we're pleased with what our teams have done. It's been a tough market.

Can you just kind of walk through some of the past metrics you've given or what you're willing to give today? I know in the past, you've given deferred revenue growth as well as penetration of certain products like FireAMP. And then secondly, HyperFlex version 3.0 was released, I believe, recently.",".

                                                   Sure. So like I said in the prepared remarks, on the security side, they continue to have   they're over   60% of their business is software. And so obviously, they have a lot of their business going through deferred revenue, and they continue to grow in high double digits. So we feel good about that. They had a very strong Q4.

Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: So I'd say it's continuing to grow very quickly. And with this addition of Duo, it really just rounds out the portfolio very well. In terms of HyperFlex, I mean, that's growing very strongly for us. I think this new release has been well-received. And again, we find ourselves in a lot of head-to-head deals and winning against Nutanix, which is obviously a really tough competitor out there. But we feel good about the offer we have. Now it's really fairly small compared to the broader data center business that has all of our servers in there.

Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: So if you just think very simply that   look back over the last 5 to 7 to 10 years, a great majority of the traffic in our enterprise customers' networks was terminating in their private data centers. So networks were architected and security architectures were built to deal with that reality. Now we're moving into a world where there is still some percentage, depending on the customer, of their traffic that is obviously terminating in a private data center. Then they have traffic terminating in SaaS applications, in multiple public cloud providers. They have this whole IoT edge data aggregation issue.","

What percentage of Cisco's enterprise customer's traffic is terminating in their private data centers?

And that's the role that we're playing with our customers because they need to re-architect their networks to accommodate a massively diverse traffic flow scenario that they're going to deal with.",".

And so many of the   you're seeing some early   some of the early work we're doing with some of the web-scale providers to ensure that we have integrated hybrid cloud solutions so that we can provide security and policy, whether applications are in the private data center or in the public.

I think if you go back and look at the earlier transitions in this space, they have largely been around delivering, and I don't want to say incrementally better, but a better performance for mobile devices that are connected to the network already.

Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: You're happier with your apps on your phones, et cetera. This is a step-level difference because we're talking about the latency dynamics of 5G and the belief that this will actually enable them to deliver real-time business applications to small offices or remote branches over 5G networks. That's a completely different dynamic. And so I would tell you that we're   we don't know yet. But I think if you operate under the assumption that it lives up to its billing, then it is going to create a significant demand on the core networks of the service providers. And so I can't say that there's a huge historical example for us to learn from. But I think what you're going to see is just between now and when they start building these things out, they're going to be working on design.","

Question: What is the biggest difference between 5G and 4G?

What is the plan for routing?"
Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: I'm wondering if there's a link between the 2 yet or that the pressure in routing has to do with other things and not to do with SD-WAN. That's the first question, kind of to understand   or maybe you can provide a different explanation, to understand the pressure on routing and what's the outlook for recovery. Or is it like Nokia and others are saying, that maybe there is a long-term pressure on this market? Second question, just a follow-up on 606. What's the impact on operating margin if you've provided this or you provide this information?

                                                   Okay, Tal, let me make a comment on the first one, and then Kelly can add to it and then she can give the 606 answer as well.",".

1. What is the outlook for routing pressure and how will it impact Cisco's operating margin?

The outlook for routing pressure is that it will impact Cisco's operating margin. The pressure on routing is due to a number of factors, including increased demand for routing services and increased competition in the routing market. However, Cisco believes that its routing capabilities and its partnerships with other providers will help it to overcome these challenges."
Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: I think when you look at our routing business, first of all   Kelly, half of it, 50%, 60% of it is SP, right? I mean, it's   so it's significantly impacted by the SP. Some of the players you mentioned, they probably have a much higher percentage of their routing businesses coming from service providers, would be my guess. So that's just sort of couched in the discussion on 5G and everything that we've said so far about SP, I'd say, is the answer on that piece of it. From an enterprise perspective, Tal, I think over the last couple of years, we've just seen a classic architectural stall in the marketplace, as we've talked about historically when there's a big architectural transition. And you said that we believe Viptela was going according to plan.",".

Question: What do you think is the reason for this stall?

Answer: We believe it's due to a lack of demand from enterprise customers for new solutions as they move to 5G."
Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: I think the way I would characterize it is we've begun to see customers actually move forward with deployments, but it's early. But we like where we are and we like what we see. So I think that   I think we'll see the enterprise continue to improve relative to this architectural clarity. And I'll let Kelly answer sort of how you think about the overall routing or the 606 question.

                                                   Yes, so on 606, Tal, so just to kind of, again, ground everybody on how we're impacted on 606, so one thing I will say is operationally, nothing has changed, right? We've made no changes to our offers. We've made no changes to our contracts or any changes to our cash conversion cycle.",".

Q1. What has changed about 606?
A1. Nothing has changed about 606."
Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: So it is literally just an accounting change. Now what the implications are to us is, like we've said, this is going to accelerate some of our term-based licenses. So we will have to write off some of our deferred revenue. We won't see that revenue, but we will offset that with acceleration of those offers when we book new orders and bill new orders. Net-net, we think it will be a net positive for us of approximately 1%. And so that's the impact on the revenue. It will fall through down through margin. So it's on operating margin, 0.5 point to 70 basis points, roughly, of goodness falling through there.",".

So like we anticipated, as we are so rapidly ramping the Cat 9K and as we are blowing out DNA across not only that, but also our Viptela offerings and across wireless, the revenue headwind was getting more closer to 2.5 to 3 points. Now the good news on this is with the new revenue standard going forward, because it's accelerating some of these offers that we did have previously defer, that headwind will become less of a headwind, okay? So as opposed to the 2.5 to 3 under current accounting standards, that will be much less, closer to like 1.5 point or so, if I had to guess roughly.",".

We are clearly seeing the results of the strategy we've articulated to you over the last 10 quarters.

What are the main drivers of Cisco's revenue growth in Q2?"
Edited version Q2 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: The network has never been more critical to business success because of its ability to simplify this complexity while enabling real-time informed business decisions. This is why Cisco is well positioned for the future as we help our customers move to highly secure and intelligent platforms for their digital businesses.
Now let me take you through what I'm seeing across the business and how Cisco's innovation is driving momentum across the portfolio. First, let's start with infrastructure platforms. We continue to be intensely focused on delivering differentiated innovation in our core, which has resulted in our return to revenue growth this quarter. Last June, we launched The Network. Intuitive., a fundamental reinvention of networking and the industry's leading intent-based networking portfolio.","

When I became CEO, I challenged our team to increase the pace of innovation in the space, and I could not be more proud of what they've accomplished.
The network is also a key enabler for our customers as they increasingly adopt a multi-cloud strategy. They need a unified, automated and scalable environment across their data centers, private clouds and public clouds. Cisco's cloud management, analytics, automation and security, combined with strategic partnerships such as Microsoft and Google, position us very well to meet customer needs.
Further extending our cloud-focused software offers, we recently introduced a Cisco container platform to simplify the deployment of cloud-native applications in containers with Kubernetes.",".

Now turning to security. Cybersecurity continues to be a top concern for customers as they evolve their enterprise architectures to address the challenges of a pervasive threat environment. We are leading the security industry with an integrated architecture and a comprehensive best-of-breed portfolio across the network, endpoint and cloud. This approach enables us to share context, intelligence, visibility and policy to reduce the time to detect and respond to threats.
We expanded our endpoint protection capabilities with Cisco Security Connector, a unique security application designed to give enterprises the deepest visibility and control over network activity on iOS devices.",".

In today's digital world, we are executing on our strategy to transition more of our business to cloud-based subscriptions and driving increased relevance at the application layer of the stack to enable a better experience for our customers.
We continue to see progress in scaling AppDynamics analytics capabilities. Over 20% of our top 500 global enterprise accounts have already adopted this technology.",".

What is the name of the company that is collaborating with Apple and Cisco?"

Tanks, Kelly. Kim, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. (Operator Instructions) 
                                        
Questions and Answers
                                        
Operator    [1]
                                        
Our first question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank Securities.",".

What is the non-GAAP gross margin rate?
The non-GAAP gross margin rate is expected to be in the range of 63% to 64%."
Edited version Q2 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call:                                         
Vijay Krishna Bhagavath,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - VP and Research Analyst    [2]
                                        
So my question is around intent based, Chuck and Kelly, please join in, which it seems like it's resonating with your customers. Is this mostly a U.S. phenomenon, Chuck? Are your overseas customers also looking into intent based? And then how do you see intent based kind of catching across the portfolio? Why not extend the intent based across the broader portfolio?                                         
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [3]
                                        
Yes. It's a great question, Vijay. First of all, we're incredibly pleased with the early acceptance of this intent-based portfolio. I called out in my opening comments that this Catalyst 9000 is the fastest-ramping product in our history, which is pretty impressive.",".                                       
Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [3]
                                        
Yes, intent-based is resonating with our customers because it's a more efficient way to manage their networks. It's also a more effective way to manage their security and compliance needs."
Edited version Q2 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: I'd say, it's fairly balanced across the geographic regions, probably pretty much in line with what percentage of the business they represent, but Kelly can validate that in just a moment. What I would tell you is that we have 3,100 customers who have adopted this platform. We obviously have the opportunity, and we will extend the capabilities across the rest of our portfolio so that our customers who are driving automation can drive it across not only campus switching but also routing, bringing the Viptela SD-WAN capabilities to play. We are integrating it backwards with ACI in the Data Center as well as within our Security portfolio.","

Q: What percentage of Cisco's business is represented by customers who have adopted the Viptela SD-WAN platform?

A: 3,100"
Edited version Q2 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: So our strategy is to continue to enhance our customers' ability to drive intent across their   all of their technology areas as well as to gain context through analytics out of all of their technologies. So 3,100 customers so far. I think our total customer population is well over 800,000, so we obviously have room to run. And we also have seen it, I'd say, from a segment perspective, the commercial marketplace has been a great adopter of the technology. And what I would tell you is that the enterprises are   have been evaluating it because it represents a different architectural approach with automation and analytics and security built into the network. So Kelly, comments on those?                                         
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [4]
                                        
Yes.",".

Question: What is Cisco's strategy for gaining customer trust?

Answer: Cisco's strategy is to continue to enhance customer's ability to drive intent across their technology areas and to gain context through analytics out of all of their technologies."
Edited version Q2 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: No, just to add to that, I mean, you're correct, I mean, the geography is split kind of in proportion, as you would expect. And across commercial, enterprise and public sector, it's fairly balanced as well. So it's just very broad-based adoption across the board. And again, we're very happy about the adoption of the more advanced software package on the advantage that's very heavily weighted towards that. So we're excited about that.

And we'll continue to add more and more of the Assurance stuff that we just launched 2 weeks ago. So we wanted to create real value in that subscription so that our customers would believe that it was worthwhile. And I think we're seeing exactly that.

Edited version Q2 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: I can tell you, from a demand perspective, we're very excited about how quickly this demand has been. And with any new product launch, we're going to get orders in faster than we recognize them in revenue. That's normal, and I'd say this ramp is normal as well. We did not have any significant supply chain issues of any sort or any shortages on this product line as well. So it's really more just we have tons of demand, and we're very happy to see how quickly the take-up is going.

Do you think this should remain roughly flat on last year? Or where should we be going with OpEx? And then secondly, I want to come back to this Cat 9K supply-demand question and just see if   is this kind of a situation   I feel like we usually ask this about smartphone launches, but has the take-up been so fast that you couldn't keep up with demand and now you're able to meet demand? Is that kind of what you're telling us with those comments? I just want to clarify that a little bit.

Question: What is Cisco's expectation for OpEx in 2018?
Answer: Cisco expects OpEx to remain roughly flat on last year."
Edited version Q2 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: So just to follow up quickly on the supply and demand. Yes, as I said, it's not a supply constraint issue at all from our supply chain or a parts shortage in any way. I mean, literally, we operate to lead times on our products. And if we get a lot of orders in the last week or 2 of a quarter when, again, as this thing is just ramping every week, we fulfill to our lead times. So there's nothing anything more than that than just we have a lot of demand for the product. So I wouldn't expect any issues as you look forward. In terms of OpEx, Rod, as you know, we are very focused on driving efficiencies. The only thing that will change in our OpEx is we are adding BroadSoft.","

Q: What is the expected impact of adding BroadSoft on your OpEx?

A: We are adding BroadSoft, which will increase our headcount by about 100 people. This will increase our OpEx by about $5 million per year."
Edited version Q2 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: So in our guidance, we will have obviously the revenue and the margin and the OpEx that comes with BroadSoft. But other than that, we are basically being very disciplined about where we're investing our R&D and making sure we're investing our R&D dollars in the best return project. So you're going to see it move around if we do acquisitions. But otherwise, we're going to be disciplined around that and invest when we can. And when we see margins go up, we're going to be investing as well. But otherwise, we're going to be managing that tightly like we have been.

Kelly, I know we're going to see it when you publish the Q, but I was hoping you could tell us the rate of price erosion.

Chuck, you've been very candid about saying that you're late making progress with respect to the cloud.

Edited version Q2 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: So yes, we're very happy with our product gross margin rate. And as you and I talk about every quarter, we look at it in terms of what we're getting from price   what headwinds we're getting from price, offset by what productivity. I would say, this quarter, we had a very, very effective price. We still had a price headwind, but it's at the lowest that it's been in many quarters. So it's less   it's 1.3 points the way that you'll see it in the Q, Paul. So we're very pleased with that. We haven't been in that level for quite some time. I think maybe Q1 of '17, we're close to that. But again, it shows the discipline between both our product management teams as well as the sales forces being very disciplined about discounting. So we're happy there.",".

Question: So you're saying that the gross margin rate was good this quarter, but there was still a price headwind?

Answer: Yes, we're very happy with our product gross margin rate. And as you and I talk about every quarter, we look at it in terms of what we're getting from price   what headwinds we're getting from price, offset by what productivity. I would say, this quarter, we had a very, very effective price. We still had a price headwind, but it's at the lowest that it's been in many quarters.

Edited version Q2 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: We also made some improvements on our productivity, where our productivity this quarter is offsetting the price erosion. So that helped a lot. And then when we get our infrastructure platforms of business going like we did, seeing that return to growth, that helps from a mix perspective. So basically, all 3 of those were very helpful to our gross margin rate this quarter. In terms of the web scale question, Paul, I mean, we don't disclose it.

Yes. Thanks, Tal. So we talked about this before, and this is happening in some of the big web-scale providers. And the great news for us is that we have several different product platforms that meet whatever need the customer's looking for because we have so many customers that will be looking at this transition at different paces.",".

Question: What are the implications of these trends on your switching and routing portfolios?
Answer: The migration from edge routers to PTX or MPLS boxes in the core, which brings down prices, and the introduction of routing into switching and what Arista calls the 7500R, are both good news for Cisco. These trends will help to drive down the cost of switching and routing equipment, making them more affordable for customers."

And we have our Nexus portfolio that continues to perform very well for customers who are building the data center architectures that we've been focused on for the last 2 or 3 years.

My question is actually more on the capital return, and so if my math is correct on the repatriation amount of $67 billion. It looks like aftertax-wise, it will be about $57 billion. And spending sounds as if you're going to spend $25 billion on the repo and then another $13 billion over the next 2 years on the dividend. That sort of leaves you, by my math, roughly about $20 billion. How should we think about sort of M&A versus either debt paydown over the next few years or other items?

Did you have the $13 billion? If I look at it, I'm in a 34 net cash position right now. We've got the $66 billion we're bringing back. We've got the share buyback and the $31 billion we plan to try to utilize over the next 18 to 24 months.

And the clarification is, Kelly, would you mind helping us understand how much BroadSoft is adding to the upcoming quarter and maybe to the most recent one, too, depending on the specific close date?

Yes, I'll get the BroadSoft. So yes, so in Q2, like I mentioned, we had about 80 basis points of impact from acquisitions, which did not have BroadSoft. When I gave my Q3 guidance, overall inorganic impact bumps up another 0.5 point to about 130 basis points. So a full point is from inorganic. And for BroadSoft   just to remind everybody, when we do an acquisition and we bring it on to our balance sheet, obviously, what deferred revenue they had ends up going through purchase accounting gets a bit of a haircut. So the first quarters will be slightly less than what they were when they were a public company. But overall, it adds   we're at 130 basis points overall at the company level.

Yes. I think it's a great question, Jason. And the rest of the businesses were generally pretty strong. So when we think about SP, obviously, one of the key variables for us is continuing to make the progress that we've been making in the web-scale community, and that's a key focus area for us as they're included in this business. So that's certainly number one.",".

1. What is the key focus area for Cisco in the Service Provider business? 
2. How do you think the progress made in the web-scale community will impact the Service Provider business?"
Edited version Q2 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2018 Cisco Systems Inc Earnings Call: Number two, the consistency of CapEx coming from everyone in the space around the world will certainly be a contributor to the future performance. So that's   I think that's the other thing that we look for. And then third, as we mentioned at the Financial Analyst Conference, we're also working on some next-generation platforms that we think can help us here as well. So if I had to just pick 3 things, those are the ones that we're focused on. And we're going to take it quarter-by-quarter and keep executing in all of those areas to try to get that business moving in the right direction. 
So with that, I just want to close by just thanking all of you for joining us today. We really appreciate you spending time with us. Appreciate the questions."," for the next question.

Ruth Porat,  Alphabet, Inc. - CFO    [3]
                                                   Thanks. Our very strong revenue of $20.3 billion in Q1 underscored the great momentum of our businesses globally, with consolidated revenue growth again accelerating meaningfully, up 23% in constant currency versus last year.",".

Question: What was the company's consolidated revenue growth rate in Q1? Answer: The company's consolidated revenue growth rate was 23% in Q1."
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: The primary driver was the increased use of mobile search by consumers, benefiting from our ongoing efforts to enhance the mobile search experience.
We also benefited from solid growth in desktop and tablet search, as well as continued strength in YouTube and programmatic advertising. We continue to rationalize our portfolio of products to ensure we efficiently and effectively focus our resources behind our biggest bets across Alphabet.
I will present to you in the following order. First, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet. Second, review the results for each of Google and Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook."," for each.

1. What was the primary driver of Alphabet's earnings growth in Q1 2016?
2. What were the results for Google and Other Bets in Q1 2016?
3. What is Alphabet's outlook for the remainder of 2016?

1. The primary driver of Alphabet's earnings growth in Q1 2016 was the increased use of mobile search by consumers, benefiting from our ongoing efforts to enhance the mobile search experience.
2. The results for Google and Other Bets in Q1 2016 were as follows: Google's revenue grew 14% year over year, while Other Bets' revenue grew by 26%.
3. Alphabet's outlook for the remainder of 2016 is as follows: ""We continue to rationalize our portfolio of products to ensure we efficiently and effectively focus our resources behind our biggest bets across Alphabet."""
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions.
Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance, total revenue was $20.3 billion, up 17% year over year, and down 5% sequentially. As a result of the ongoing strength of the US dollar, we realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year over year of $762 million, or $593 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 23% year over year and declined 4% sequentially, reflecting holiday seasonality.
Once again, Alphabet revenues by geography highlight both the strength of our business around the globe, as well as the impact that currency headwinds continue to have on our non-US business.",".

What was the impact of currency headwinds on Alphabet's non-US business?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: US revenue was up 21% year over year to $9.4 billion, and down 9% versus Q4.
UK revenue was up 15% year over year to $1.9 billion, and flat sequentially. In fixed FX terms, the UK grew 21% year over year and 5% quarter over quarter. Rest of world revenue was up 14% versus last year to $9 billion and down 2% versus Q4. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 25% year over year, and up 1% sequentially.
GAAP other cost of revenues were $3.9 billion.",".

What was the other cost of revenues for Alphabet Inc.?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3.6 billion, up 27% year over year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, most notably due to costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, and hardware costs related to sales of new Nexus, Chromecast and Pixel devices launched in the fall.
GAAP operating expenses were $7.3 billion in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6 billion, or 30% of revenue, up 11% year over year, and down 9% versus Q4. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by R&D expense, mainly due to compensation expense related to head count growth.
On a GAAP basis, operating income was $5.3 billion, up 20% versus last year. The operating margin was 26%. Non-GAAP operating income was $6.8 billion, up 21% versus last year.",".

What was the main driver of growth in non-GAAP operating expenses?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: The operating margin was 34%.
With respect to stock-based compensation, it totaled $1.5 billion, up 24% year over year, and up 4% sequentially, primarily reflecting increased head count and the impact of our senior executive equity refresh that occurs every two years. Head count at the end of the quarter was 64,115, up approximately 2,300 from last quarter. The vast majority of new hires continue to be engineers and product managers in areas where we've prioritized investment, such as Cloud and apps.
On a numbers basis, we're adding more head count in Google, while on a percentage basis we're growing faster in Other Bets. Other income and expense was negative $213 million.",".

Question: What was the operating margin for Alphabet Inc's fiscal Q1 2016?
Answer: The operating margin was 34%."
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: As discussed on prior calls, OI&E consists of a number of line items with different drivers, which makes it inherently unpredictable.
The key drivers this quarter were the ongoing drag from foreign exchange, given the volatility in currency markets, as well as losses recorded for marketable and nonmarketable securities. These items offset interest income from our investment portfolio, which remains fairly consistent.
Our effective tax rate was 18%, reflecting the geographic mix of our income and adoption of a new accounting standard that reflects certain SBC tax benefits in GAAP earnings that were previously recognized in equity. We have excluded these benefits in our non-GAAP earnings.
Net income was $4.2 billion on a GAAP basis, and $5.2 billion on a non-GAAP basis.",".

What is the effective tax rate for Alphabet Inc?
The effective tax rate for Alphabet Inc was 18%."
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Earnings per diluted share were $6.02 on a GAAP basis, and $7.50 on a non-GAAP basis.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, the substantial majority of which supported the Google segment. Operating cash flow was $7.7 billion, with free cash flow of $5.2 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $75.3 billion, of which approximately $45 billion, or 60%, is held overseas. This reflects our strong operating cash flow offset by the impact of our share repurchases during the quarter of approximately $2.1 billion.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment, revenue was $20.1 billion, up 17% year over year, which includes the impact of FX.",".

Question: What was the impact of FX on Google's revenue?
Answer: The impact of FX on Google's revenue was a 17% increase due to the strong U.S. dollar."
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenue was $14.3 billion in the quarter, up 20% year over year, and down 4% sequentially.
Year-on-year growth reflects substantial strength in mobile search due to the ongoing benefit from the improvement in ad formats and delivery that we launched in the third quarter of last year. We continue to have solid growth from desktop and tablet search.
YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and Google Preferred, with a growing contribution from app promotion. Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 3% year on year, and down 11% sequentially, continuing to reflect the strong growth of programmatic, offset by the traditional network businesses.
Other revenue for Google was $2.1 billion, up 24% year over year, and down 1% sequentially.",".

What is the main driver of Google's revenue growth?
The main driver of Google's revenue growth is its strong performance in mobile search."
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Year-over-year performance was driven by Play, as well as continued strong growth in Cloud and apps and a nice contribution from hardware.
Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. As a reminder, these metrics similarly are affected by currency movements.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $3.8 billion, or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 13% year over year, and down 7% sequentially. The increase in both sites TAC and network TAC as a percentage of revenue reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
Operating income excluding SBC was $7.6 billion, up 22% versus last year, for an operating margin of 38%.",".

What was the increase in TAC as a percentage of revenue? The increase in TAC as a percentage of revenue reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile and programmatic, carry higher TAC."
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Google stock-based compensation totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter, up 25% year over year. Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $6.3 billion, up 21% versus last year, and the operating margin was 31%. CapEx for the quarter was $2 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction.
Turning to Other Bets' financials, as a reminder, the majority of these efforts are pre revenue. We continue to invest across these opportunities, doing so in a disciplined way.",".

What was the total stock-based compensation for Alphabet Inc's Q1 2016 earnings call?
The total stock-based compensation for Alphabet Inc's Q1 2016 earnings call was $1.3 billion."
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Because Other Bets' results aggregate the revenues and expenses from a number of businesses, operating in different industries, there is likely to be lumpiness in the reported results from quarter to quarter, which is why we think it remains most instructive to look at them over a longer time horizon.
For Q1, Other Bets revenue was $166 million, up 108% versus last year. Reported revenue for Other Bets was primarily generated by Nest, Verily and Fiber. Operating loss excluding SBC was $657 million in the first quarter. Including the impact of SBC, operating loss was $802 million. Other Bets' CapEx was $280 million in Q1, primarily reflecting ongoing investment in our Fiber business.
Looking forward, a few observations. First, regarding revenue, our culture of innovation drives our strong revenue growth.",".

What is the main driver of Other Bets' 108% revenue growth in Q1?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We've talked previously about the benefits from changes made to ad formats and delivery in the third quarter of 2015 and that continues to be a tail wind. Mobile, as an example, continues to offer sizable opportunity for revenue enhancement, given the increasing ubiquity of mobile use by consumers and the strong location and contextual signals from mobile devices. Although we remain intensely focused on innovation across Alphabet, the timing and magnitude of ongoing changes obviously are inherently uncertain and are not designed with an eye toward quarterly schedules.
Second, as to expenses, within Google, we continue to be focused on managing the expenses that we can actually control, as you can see from our results again this quarter.",".

Question: What are the ""ongoing changes"" that Alphabet is ""intensely focused on?""
Answer: These changes could include changes to ad formats and delivery, as well as expenses within Google."
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: However, the secular trends driving revenue are accompanied by greater required investment in our ecosystem to support that revenue growth, most specifically the continued trend of higher TAC due to an ongoing change in mix within our sites and network businesses.
Third, regarding CapEx, as we have consistently said, technical infrastructure is a key strategic asset for us. We have tremendous scale and continue to add to it. The team continues to deliver innovative solutions that are creating meaningful efficiencies in machine use, allowing us to benefit from earlier investments and meet our growing Google requirements cost effectively.",".

Question: What is the company's plan for increasing CapEx?
Answer: The company plans to increase CapEx in order to maintain its technical infrastructure."
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: With regard to CapEx investments for Other Bets, the bulk of that is directed to our Fiber business, where CapEx should obviously increase as we execute in a growing number of cities.
Fourth, about our balance sheet, as I discussed on our Q4 call, last quarter we initiated steps to align our capital structure consistent with the move to Alphabet, providing greater flexibility as we continue to grow. Our exchange offer will be completed on April 25 and we have completed the move of our commercial paper and revolving credit facility from Google to Alphabet.
Finally, our strategic prioritization   as I indicated last quarter, there are a number of different execution paths we are pursuing to optimize our investments and opportunities.",".

What is the bulk of CapEx investment for Other Bets directed to?
The bulk of CapEx investment for Other Bets is directed to our Fiber business."
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: In some areas, we will be increasing investment if teams meet milestones we set as part of our 2016 budgeting process. In other areas, we've chosen to work with industry-leading partners who can increase our momentum.
Finally, in certain areas where we have had multiple teams developing different approaches to a similar technology, we've been evaluating how to rationalize these approaches, enabling us to increase investments around a smaller, more focused set of opportunities. So, my closing comment is that in Q1, we continue to see tremendous revenue growth across our businesses and we remain focused on disciplined investing for the long term.
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.                                         
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet, Inc. - CEO of Google    [4]

2. What industry-leading partners will Alphabet be working with?

Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it accessible and useful. And after 17 years, we have just scratched the surface of what's possible. We are reinvigorated around this mission and, as you will hear, we are making solid progress across many of our products.

Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Then I'll give an update on our advertising business and our growing Cloud business.
A few highlights from the quarter. We continue to invest in making search more useful and assistive. In the early days when you did a search on your desktop, we gave you 10 blue links and then sent you on your way. Users still had to do too much work to find the information they were looking for.
We have made a lot of improvements over the years to add more comprehensive and assistive information right within the search results. For instance, 10 years ago, if you tried to find the score during your favorite soccer team's match, we would likely point to you some news articles or the team's website."," for each of the following:

3. Alphabet Inc. has made a lot of improvements to its search results over the years by adding more comprehensive and assistive information right within the search results."
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Today, we show the live scores for nearly 200 soccer leagues across 70 countries so fans around the world can quickly find information, like upcoming schedules, team news, and conference standings, right in the search results. We are incredibly well positioned to better assist our users, thanks to our strengths in areas like search, geographical information, machine learning, image recognition, and natural language processing.
One of the key ingredients behind this push towards greater assistance is AI. We have long invested in building the best machine learning team and tools, and we are seeing these efforts bear fruit in many ways.
As many of you saw last month DeepMind's AlphaGo has been making great strides. It was a privilege to play legendary Go player, Lee Sedol, in such an important milestone for artificial intelligence.","

What is AlphaGo's next goal?"

At Google, machine learning is already helping us improve our products every day, in search and many other areas like photos, maps and more. Last quarter, I talked about how machine learning helps Smart Reply suggests responses in Inbox.
This quarter, we launched Goals in Google Calendar, an intelligent feature that helps users make the most of their time. You just add a personal goal, like ""run three times a week,"" and Calendar will help you find the time, then help you stick to it.

On the content side, we are seeing great traction on Google Play and YouTube. YouTube still has incredible momentum and we continue to invest heavily here. What seemed like a moonshot a decade ago has grown into a booming community of engaged users, creators and brands, unlike any other video platform. YouTube on mobile alone now reaches more 18- to 34- and 18- to 49-year-olds in the US than any TV network, broadcast or cable.
This past quarter, we launched YouTube Originals, original content available on our premium service YouTube Red, and we are very pleased with how it's been going. And earlier this week we announced that we are making 360-degree live streaming available globally on YouTube.",".

I want to specifically highlight the success we are seeing with YouTube advertising. As YouTube continues to grow with great content and engaged users, marketers can't get enough.

What have you learned from the early days of original content and a subscription offering and how that might allow YouTube to evolve and change over time as a product offering?

We've learned that creating great original content is key to success on YouTube. With a subscription offering, we're able to incent viewers to come back every month, which helps us build an audience that is more engaged with our content.

I think you could see that from the growth rates with US up 21% year over year. That was really strength across products.
UK, we're really pleased with the team. We continue to see great execution there, on a fixed FX basis, as I noted, up 21%.",".

                                                   Hi. I have two quick questions. First, on margins, despite the increasing TAC as a percentage of revenues, adjusted operating margins expanded almost 140 bps for Google year on year.",". 
And then secondly, on the Street, some people are wondering if Alphabet is getting too big. I'm wondering if you could talk about how you think Alphabet's size compares to other tech companies and what you think the implications might be for the company's future growth.

Hi Carlos. Thanks for coming in. As you mentioned, margins expanded 140bps year-on-year, despite the increasing TAC as a percentage of revenues. This was largely due to continued strong performance in our core businesses, including search and YouTube. We believe that our scale and unique capabilities give us a competitive advantage, and we're committed to using our resources to continue building value for our shareholders. We don't believe that Alphabet's size compares to other tech companies, and we don't believe that it has any implications for the company's future growth. Thanks."
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Can you help us understand, even if roughly, how much of this margin expansion is specific to the quarter, like due to FX versus systemic or secular, so to speak?
And the second question, I think maybe for Sundar, can you talk a bit about the decision you took last year to have an additional ad on mobile search response pages, relegating organic results below the fold? How is it good for the user experience to have ads instead of organic? And if it is good, what does it say about the potential for innovation in organic search? Thank you.

                                                   Thanks, Carlos. Starting on the margin question, you've hit a couple of the components.",".

What was the main driver of Alphabet's margin expansion in the third quarter?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: So, I'm going to try and just break it down into the drivers on cost of sales versus OpEx more broadly, as you asked it.
In cost of sales or the gross margin trend, as I tried to make clear, certain costs associated with revenue are going up, given secular trends in the market. So in sites, mobile carries higher TAC than does desktop, and mobile remains a strong growth driver, so we do expect this to continue. Then on the network side, we have strong growth in programmatic and that carries higher TAC than traditional ad buying. The obvious result is more revenue and gross margin dollars, but at a lower margin.
And then on OpEx, more broadly, we remain very committed to long-term revenue growth and profit, as we've talked about on prior calls.",".

What is the reason for the lower gross margin on OpEx?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We did set priorities in the 2016 budget and we made some tough choices because our aim is to be as efficient and effective as possible with investment dollars, while properly funding the big opportunities that we have that are reflected in OpEx.
So as I've repeatedly said, some of the biggest bets are in Google. Sundar commented quite a bit on Cloud. That's an exciting opportunity. We want to continue to add head count to drive growth. And all of this is consistent with our goals of driving long-term growth in revenue and profit.
So, it goes to my opening comments that we're focused on controlling the expenses we have. And then there are certain trends, as I noted, in particular on the TAC side, that have been increasing with the strong growth we're seeing in mobile and programmatic.",".

                                                   And, Carlos, on the ad side, we are incredibly sensitive to the user experience on search. So, we are constantly evolving how we display ads. But we take a very long-term view. Our ads quality efforts, these are people who have been working on this for many years, and they are squarely focused on optimizing for positive metrics across users and advertisers.
So, our utmost focus is making sure for users these changes have a positive impact. Mobile is an entirely different paradigm. There's a lot of things that are counter intuitive. For example, users are very comfortable swiping on mobile. We deeply think about these things and I'm very comfortable about how we are planning this for the very long term.

It was down 9% quarter on quarter. And I know that you picked up Yahoo and lost AOL from 4Q to 1Q. So is that the primary driver of that, or as YouTube becomes a bigger percent of your revenue, should we expect greater seasonal uptick in 4Q and seasonal downtick in 1Q? Can you just give us a little bit more color on what's driving that? Thanks.

Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. CEO   

Thank you, Doug. So on mobile search pricing, we view that as a long-term investment and it's early days. We're really excited about the potential for mobile search to help enterprises really understand their data, understand how best they can do what their core competencies are, really revolutionize around that. And on Amazon, we view it as a long-term opportunity. We're excited about the potential for them to enter the enterprise market."

I think you're trying to get more color on mobile, and what's hopefully clear from the opening comments is that mobile continues to outperform. Desktop growth did pick up modestly in Q1, but from opening comments it should be clear that mobile search revenue was up significantly.
And then in terms of your question on other income, let me point you to the OI&E table that's at the end of our press release. This line consists of a number of different items.",".

What was the increase in mobile search revenue in Q1?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: They can be affected by different trends, but you can see the breakout in that table, which hopefully is helpful there.
Interest income has been fairly consistent. We do continue to manage our portfolio conservatively. FX is consistently an expense here. It was slightly elevated again this quarter, given the ongoing volatility in foreign exchange markets. We haven't changed our approach yet, but upward volatility in the markets.
Then the OI&E line also includes changes in value or equity pickups related to marketable and nonmarketable securities and investments. We appreciate with all of those different line items, it's tough to forecast, but you can see the detail attached to the press release.

And, Ruth, a housekeeping item on the CapEx here. When you talk about CapEx for the Other Bets being primarily for Fiber, is this a fairly straightforward passing of homes, or is your cash used going toward developing new technology or products like Sky Vendor?

                                                   And then on the CapEx question, if I just broaden that a bit, the CapEx trend is in part efficiency, in part is timing. When you look at year-over-year spend compared to last year, we had some outsized machine spend that filled some recently constructed data centers. And as we've consistently said, our technical infrastructure is a really key strategic asset for us. We have tremendous scale.",".

What is Alphabet's strategy for spending its capital?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We continue to add to it and the team has done an extraordinary job innovating to deliver some meaningful efficiencies in machine use, and that enables us to benefit from earlier investments.
Although you asked about the Fiber side, just to build off of what Sundar was saying on Cloud, given what a strategic priority that is for us and the requirements for a leading Cloud business are clearly at the core of all that we do, and at a scale that's unmatched given our sustained investments in infrastructure, one of the things that was also mentioned at Next is that we plan to add 12 new regions.",".

Question: What regions will be added to the 12 already announced?
Answer: The 12 new regions are as follows: Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle."
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: To be clear, we're going to be using multiple execution paths for those data center requirements.
In other words, every Cloud region isn't necessarily going to be housed in a Google data center, so we don't need to build data centers in all of these places. They will all incorporate the same Google hardware and software and meet the same performance, reliability and security requirements. And investing in Cloud isn't only about CapEx. We also put a lot of head count behind that again this quarter.
And then, more specifically, on the Fiber side, as you are pointing to, we do expect that to increase throughout the year as we execute on the cities that we've already announced. It's primarily about continuing to execute on those cities.",".

Q: What is the primary reason for investing in Cloud?
A: The primary reason for investing in Cloud is to improve performance, reliability and security."
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We now are up to 22 announced cities, two most recent announcements being some buildings, we're bringing Fiber to select buildings in San Francisco and we're working with the city of Huntsville. That being said, I liked your question because we're also very focused on innovation and technology. So, so it's really both but predominantly continued execution against the cities that we've announced.

The first is we have always been doing Cloud. It's just been consuming it all internally at Google. But as we have grown, really mature in terms of how we handle our data center investments and how we can do this at scale, we have definitely crossed over to the other side where we can thoughtfully serve external customers.

And so those are the three main reasons why we are significantly ramping up what we are doing there.

We've consistently said it's early days. You asked about ROIC.",".

What is Alphabet's current ROIC?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We're really excited about the magnitude of the opportunity, as Sundar has talked about. And one thing that's really powerful here is we're benefiting from our heritage, from our differentiated strength, the scale of our infrastructure. Those are investments we've made over many years that give us extraordinary efficiency.
We have robust security. Again, we've invested over many years. We have unparalleled machine learning. And so, really, when we think through to the ROIC opportunity compelling, building on investments that we've made and continue to make in a very exciting opportunity.

What are the key drivers of Alphabet's growth potential?"
Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: First, for Sundar on Google Fiber, just at a higher level, would you please broadly update us on your learnings from Google Fiber up until this point? And what are the goals that Google is trying to achieve with Google Fiber in terms of longer-term ambitions, in terms of TV or video distribution?
And then, Ruth, you mentioned in your prepared remarks mobile search being driven by improvements in ad formats and deliveries starting in the third quarter of last year. Is there any way to frame or think about what sites revenue growth might be on a recurring basis if we were to try to exclude the impacts or benefits from the changes in formats that you mentioned, and as we start to think about the year-over-year growth comparisons there for the back half of 2016?

                                                   Let me go ahead and start on the Fiber question. Fiber is one of the businesses that is in Other Bets. And like all of our access efforts, we're really focused and our vision here is to create abundant and ubiquitous networks. We think there's a lot of opportunity to improve the experience that users have. And that's where the Fiber team is focused.
We have some other efforts within Other Bets that are really exciting, as well, that address access, within our X businesses targeting the 4 billion people still offline, and we view that as a big opportunity and an important problem to address.
In terms of the early learnings, there have been a lot.",".

And then in terms of the change in ad format, as we've talked about on a lot of calls, innovation is core to all we do. It obviously happens on its own time line. We have a culture of it. We're continuously focused on it. Not going to break out impact for any change.",".

There was a stepup, which we've talked about, and we continue to look at other ways, as Sundar talked about, to continue to enhance the user experience. But I think the most important point, and somewhat implicit in your question, that shouldn't take away from the very strong underlying revenue and revenue growth that we have in that business.

Then the second one, on the desktop. Ruth, you mentioned that desktop picked up in the first quarter. What drove that pickup in growth? And any learnings from the change in the right-hand rail in the first quarter? Thanks.

                                                   And then in terms of the desktop format change, we had a modest benefit from that change where, just to be clear for all, we reduced the ad load by removing ads on the right side of the screen, while adding a fourth ad slot for highly commercial queries. And, in the aggregate, that resulted in a cleaner, more useful presentation and improved user experience. It was a modest impact, but additive.

                                                   Ben, on the first question, I think that's a good question. We are seeing traction across categories, it's just that games are on a much larger scale. But for example, when we get into education, if you view that as a vertical, we do see traction there, and so on.
I think taking a very long-term view, it will probably reflect where there are commercial opportunities across every vertical.",".

But I think, importantly, we're benefiting from an important secular trend behind mobile, and like the revenue dollars and the gross profit dollars that come as a result of that. And we'll continue to innovate on mobile and are excited about the opportunity in particular with all the changes that we continue to see in the way users use the phone and the opportunities.

Revenue momentum in Q4 underscored the strength of our businesses globally, with consolidated revenue growth accelerating meaningfully versus last year.

As Larry articulated in the 2013 founders letter, and then again when announcing the creation of Alphabet, incrementalism in technology leads to irrelevance over time because change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary.","

What is Alphabet's strategy for continuing to be relevant in the technology industry?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: This belief was the impetus for our organizational structure, which enhances focus on opportunities within Google and across Alphabet, while also pushing our leadership to extend the frontier that we are addressing.
Consistent with the move to Alphabet, we expanded transparency internally regarding the expenses and CapEx required in each business, which benefited our 2016 budgeting process and capital allocation decision making. As part of this process, we established technical and business targets for a number of the businesses to set the appropriate pace of investment. We made necessary choices to align resources with those efforts that maximize the potential for long-term value creation, prioritizing certain efforts while making tough calls in others.
Given the fact that we are innovating in a number of exciting industries, in some areas, the optimal execution path could encourage accelerated investment.",".

What was the impetus for Alphabet's organizational structure?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: In others, we continue to receive interest in exploring partnerships or alternate approaches to commercializing our efforts.
Verily is a great example of where we formed strategic partnerships with companies like Dexcom, J&J, Novartis and Sanofi in order to accelerate our efforts. My main point here is that we remain on a journey and it is still early days. We are working diligently to build additional businesses that create long-term revenues, profits, and value.
Looking forward, a few observations. First, regarding revenue. As a reminder, the fourth quarter tends to be seasonally our strongest quarter, reflecting the benefit of the holidays. In addition, our GAAP results will continue to be affected by changes in the relative strength of the dollar.
Second, operating expenses.",".

What is Verily's strategy for reducing operating expenses?
Verily's strategy for reducing operating expenses includes forming strategic partnerships with companies like Dexcom, J&J, Novartis and Sanofi in order to accelerate our efforts."
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: As I said last quarter, our priority remains revenue growth, but that doesn't give us a pass on a rigorous approach to expense management. We continue to invest in longer-term opportunities within both Google and Other Bets, consistent with our emphasis on pushing the frontier to adjacent areas and moon shots. Given the early stage nature of a number of these efforts, they're likely to require additional investment prior to generating meaningful revenues.
Notably, in many ways some of Alphabet's biggest moon shots are in Google itself.",".

What are Alphabet's biggest moon shots in Google?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: From driving the next wave of computing through machine learning, capitalizing on the shift to the cloud by enterprises, building platforms like virtual reality and pursuing the opportunities we see with the next billion users in emerging markets, you should expect Google to continue to invest in efforts to improve life for billions of people.
Third, CapEx. As we've indicated previously, the vast majority of CapEx supports Google. We view our computing capacity as a core competence and will continue to invest here given our advantages in providing efficient, secure computing to support growth in both our consumer products and services globally, as well as our cloud and apps businesses.
In Other Bets, the majority of CapEx supports the ongoing deployment of Google Fiber.",".

What is the vast majority of CapEx that Google invests in?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We are still operating in only a few cities, but have announced plans for additional cities which we expect will be reflected in 2016 CapEx.
Fourth, our balance sheet. In 2016, we intend to align our capital structure with the Alphabet organization so that debt is held at the holding Company level. That alignment would allow us to have greater flexibility as we continue to grow, including the ability to utilize debt financing if appropriate and consistent with our changing product mix.
So my closing comment is that we saw tremendous revenue growth across our businesses and are applying discipline as we move to implement the Alphabet structure.
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.

Above all, our Q4 results show the great momentum and opportunity we have in Mobile Search and across Google's range of businesses. What's most exciting is the incredible enthusiasm for our products among consumers and our partners.
Two things show this. First on our last call, I shared that six of our consumer products, Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, and Google Play all have over 1 billion monthly active users each. I'm pleased to share that Gmail now joins those ranks, crossing that number last quarter. Of course, all of these products are very popular and continue to grow rapidly on mobile.
Second, there is incredible momentum behind the Android ecosystem and the model is working at scale.",":

What are the six consumer products that have over 1 billion monthly active users each?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: This is a group of companies with whom we have worked really hard to build strong relationships. At the center of this are Android phones and it's exciting to see the lineup of flagship devices our partners are working on this year. And there are newer areas which are showing a lot of promise.
In addition to an Android Wear partnership with New Balance and a new smart watch from our friends at Casio, over 40 car brands worldwide are bringing Android Auto to their cars. Dozens of partners are integrating Android TV and Google Cast technology into living room products launching this year.
I want to talk about two main things today. First, some thoughts on the approach we are taking to drive the next wave of innovation.",".

What is the approach to driving the next wave of innovation?

The approach to driving the next wave of innovation is to focus on building strong relationships with partners and focusing on areas of potential innovation."
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: And then some thoughts on our advertising business and our newer emerging businesses.
First, a few words on our approach. At Google, we've always tried to bring our unique technical strengths to areas where we think we can make a big difference, like indexing the world's information to make it discoverable.
We have focused a lot on really improving Search and Mobile and now we are investing in evolving this to actively assist our users throughout the day in smart and helpful ways. This comes thanks to our years of investments in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, Knowledge Graph and other areas.","

What are Alphabet's plans for its advertising business?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: And the next wave will be powered by big advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, an area where we believe we lead the industry.
Just last week, DeepMind published an incredible result, the first ever to master the game of Go with artificial intelligence, an amazing accomplishment, and I'm excited for the world championship in March. And in November, we open sourced TensorFlow, our new machine learning system, to help accelerate discovery and development in the field.
Machine learning is making our products smarter and more useful for people every day. It powers Smart Reply inInbox by Gmail which suggests short responses that are relevant to an incoming e-mail.
People absolutely love this feature. In fact, in just a few months, Smart Reply already makes up 10% of all mobile responses in Inbox.",".

What is the first thing that machine learning is powering?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: From image recognition in Photos, to eliminating e-mail spam, to better translation and voice recognition, our machine learning efforts are making a huge difference for people every day.
In sum, we believe we have only scratched the surface of truly being there for our users, any time, any where, across all devices, giving them the assistance they need. We are excited to make even more progress on this vision in 2016.
The second part of our approach is to make sure we are solving big problems for everyone. We believe that someone in Indonesia should get the same quality e-mail service or search results as someone in New York.
This quarter, I visited Korea, Vietnam and India to speak with partners, developers and students. It was a very inspiring trip.","

What are some of the big problems you are trying to solve?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: I even sat down at a local coffee shop with Dong Nguyen, the creator of the popular Flappy Bird game, which has inspired Vietnam's growing community of developers and startups to think hard about how to create worldwide hits.
From providing Internet access in India's railway stations to making Chromebooks available throughout the region, it reinforced what a huge opportunity we have to help the next billion users come online and to have great experiences with the whole Internet once they are there. That's why creating open platforms that anyone can build on is core to Google's DNA, from Chrome to Android to Brillo to our latest virtual reality efforts.
It's still incredibly early innings for virtual reality as a platform and Cardboard is just the first step, but we are excited by the progress we have seen.",".

What is Google's strategy for virtual reality?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Our partners have shipped over 5 million Google Cardboard viewers and we recently teamed up with the New York Times on a virtual reality experience in which over 1 million Times subscribers received Cardboard.
And since launching in September, the Expeditions Pioneer Program has helped more than 500,000 students travel to places like the bottom of the sea or the surface of Mars. Beyond these early efforts, you'll see a lot more from us and our partners in 2016.
Now turning to the trends and highlights that we're seeing across our advertising business, as well as some of the newer areas. It's hard to believe that AdWords just celebrated its 15th birthday. Just like Google Search, and the computing devices we all use now, the product is largely unrecognizable from the first version that launched in 2000.",".

What is the product's age? 
The product is largely unrecognizable from the first version that launched in 2000."
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: But the key value proposition remains unchanged.
Google helps advertisers reach the right customer at precisely the right micro moment, when they're looking to buy something, go somewhere, know something or do something. Mobile is really helping us making these connections for marketers. As Ruth mentioned, Mobile Search was particularly strong in the fourth quarter.
This holiday season we found that shopping moments replaced shopping marathons. Shoppers turned to their mobile devices to purchase gifts online in spare moments throughout the day all season long, and marketers turned to our mobile ad offerings to reach those customers. And people are actively buying products when searching on mobile.
Our research those that 30% of all online shopping purchases now happen on mobile phones.",".

What is the percentage of online shopping purchases that happen on mobile phones?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: In fact, in the US looking just at product listing ads, revenue from mobile phones exceeded desktop on Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and through the weekend. Not only were people using mobile ads to shop online, they also used their phones to find the best products and prices in stores around them.
Our local inventory ads helps people see if a product they are looking for is in stock at a retailer nearby. Marketers at Lowe's and Target find them useful because they can measure the foot traffic that their search ads drove. In fact, thanks to local inventory ads, Target reported millions of incremental store visits in the week leading up to Christmas.
We also continue to see great success in driving app downloads.","

What was the success of Target's local inventory ads?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Our app promotion offerings like universal app campaigns, which helped marketers easily run campaigns in Google Play, YouTube, Search and across our display network, are getting great traction and delivering results for our advertisers. We are now seeing a trend of advertisers moving their app install budgets to Google.
Now moving to video. People watch hundreds of millions of hours on YouTube every day and it continues to be a must have for all brand advertisers. Not only does YouTube on mobile reach more 18 to 49-year-olds than any cable network in the US, but the time people spent watching YouTube in the living room more than doubled in 2015.
Brands turn to YouTube to inspire and engage potential customers. And with our recently launched shoppable TrueView ads, marketers like Michael Kors can connect the dots between inspiration and purchase.",".

What is the trend of advertisers moving their app install budgets to Google?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: And it is brands of all sizes. In fact, over the last two years the number of small and medium-sized businesses advertising on YouTube has doubled. We also continue to expand measurement options for marketers on YouTube to help them better understand the effectiveness of their ad spend.
In addition to our own measurement tools, we recently introduced support for third party viewability vendors on YouTube. YouTube is also a powerful platform for creators. Today, any creator can upload a video to YouTube and get discovered by over 1 billion people around the world. That global exposure has allowed YouTube and Google to pay out over $3 billion to the record industry to date.
We are also investing in the future of video.",".

What is the number of small and medium-sized businesses advertising on YouTube?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: You can now watch VR videos on YouTube and content creators can now film in new YouTube spaces in Paris and Mumbai. Between incredibly strong viewership growth, the move of advertising budgets to digital video, great new features, as well as the successful rollouts of YouTube Music and our YouTube Red subscription offering, I couldn't be more excited about the prospects for YouTube in the years ahead.
In programmatic video and display, we continue to see strong momentum. More marketers and publishers used programmatic automated ad buying and tools through our DoubleClick platform this holiday season than ever before. Programmatic video impressions doubled compared to the holiday season last year.","

What is the ""programmatic video"" trend?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: And in the week leading up to Black Friday, more than 60% of programmatic impressions came from mobile devices.
Lastly, I'll discuss some of our newer business areas where we continue to see tremendous potential. Google Play, our hub for digital content, continues to see great momentum. In 2015, spend per buyer in the Play store grew by more than 30% globally compared to 2014. We had particularly strong growth in this area in countries like Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Mexico, thanks to continued investments in payments capabilities.
On hardware, as you know, last quarter we launched the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P in more than 30 countries. They are truly great examples of the best that Android can offer and have gotten great reviews.","

What is the Play store's growth rate in countries like Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Mexico?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: And the adoption of Chromebooks continues to gain a ton of momentum, particularly in education.
Before I wrap up, I want to share some thoughts on our Cloud and Apps group. Public cloud services are a natural place for us so we established a business unit late last year to take full advantage of the opportunity.
I'm excited that Diane Greene, a highly respected industry vet, joined to lead it. As you know, Google pioneered the cloud at scale. Our data centers have handled the workload of Google's own products from Search to YouTube for 17 years. We are able to take that infrastructure and computing power and optimize it for all customers.
Our data centers, infrastructure, machine learning and premium data services are leaders in the cloud space, as is our price to performance ratio.",".

What is the Cloud and Apps group's mission?

The Cloud and Apps group's mission is to take full advantage of the opportunity to establish public cloud services for Google."
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: And we are now able to bring this to bear just as the movement to cloud has reached a tipping point. Businesses now see that the easiest to use, most price effective and secureinfrastructure can best be obtained through the major public cloud providers.
Google Cloud platform is already used by more than 4 million applications and we recently introduced a new way to purchase and use virtual machines called custom machine types, so that clients can tailor their purchases based on the memory they need to get the best possible cost and performance.
Our business collaboration and productivity suite, Google Apps, now incorporates the best of Google's new technologies like machine learning and natural language processing.",".

What is the tipping point for businesses moving to public cloud?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Our adoption now extends from large healthcare providers to retailers to government.
Last quarter, Catholic Health Initiatives, the nation's second largest non-profit health system, with more than 100,000, employees announced it has moved to Google Apps. There's great buzz at Google around this area and we continue to heavily ramp up investment here.
I want to say thank you to all of the Googlers around the world for their amazing work, from cloud computing, digital video, and the mobile revolution, to machine learning, virtual reality and helping the next billion get online, Google has a front row seat on the trends that will define computing in the coming years. There is truly no more exciting place to come to work every day.

                                                   Hello. Thank you for taking my questions. I have a couple. First, Sundar, do you believe there's a non-trivial chance of Google and the DeepMind team achieving strong AI in the next five years or so?
And, secondly, on your revenues, can you tell us whether you feel the drivers of sites revenue growth and what seems to be an acceleration have legs and are more like improving user experience and advertising returns and less like increasing ad loads which one could argue have limited headway? Thank you.

Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: I'll answer the first one, and turn it over to Ruth on the second. On AI, we are, obviously, seeing incredible progress in this field. We make great strides and we start taking it for granted and look to the years ahead. It's always tough to predict what happens over a five-year time frame, but I do see us making significant strides.
Even a year ago, I wouldn't have predicted that we would be in a strong position to mount a serious challenge to the world champion in Go this year. Looking at the pace of progress, I think we will have AI in a form in which it benefits a lot of users in the coming years, but I still think it's early days and this is a long-term investment for us.

                                                   And then on sites revenue, what the results reflect is product strength, geographic breadth and obviously, the added backdrop of an active holiday season with the sites revenue up 20% year-on-year, notwithstanding the currency impact. The way we look at it is we've got extraordinary capability and strength in Search and then ongoing innovation across the platform. As we talked about last quarter, we did benefit from a change made in Q3 in ad format with respect to Mobile Search and we do continue to benefit from that change.
Mobile Search growth was the biggest driver again this quarter. And then in terms of YouTube, the momentum continues, the story continues to be about strong growth in video advertising, TrueView and Google Preferred as distinct from display on YouTube.",".

Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: As you look at some of the numbers, the reason I said it's more instructive to look at annual or rolling 12 months is that there can be some lumpy things on a quarterly basis, but we're continuing to invest across the businesses as we talked about.
So that would explain the 2014, 2015 trend here; it just underscores that we are investing in the business. We've made some tough choices, and as I said, in terms of you how we're allocating across the various businesses, but an important area for us and tried to give you the sizing here in the segment information. And then in terms of overall Google, we're continuing to invest there, as well.
We're investing quite meaningfully, as I previously said, the 70-20-10 model is an instructive framework that Larry has articulated for a long time.",".

What is the 70-20-10 model?

Any more detail on that would really be helpful, if those individual businesses have accelerated. And then on the Other Bets business, clearly   and you've mentioned milestones a couple times.",".

Ruth Porat: So on the US acceleration, we saw very strong year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. And again, similarly, we're just executing against that business plan. So on YouTube and Search, we continue to see strong growth, driven by continued growth in watch time and search queries. And Other Bets, we've now crossed a number of key milestones, including generating $1 billion in annualized revenue and signing up over 1 million customers. So those are all good signs that we're on track to achieve our goals.
Justin Post: Okay. And then finally, on the capital allocation front, you mentioned that you're going to be investing in new products and services. Can you give us a little more color on that? What are some of the new products and services that you're looking to invest in?
Ruth Porat: So we're still in the early stages of thinking about what new products and services we'll be investing in.

                                                   Sure. So starting with the US, I think the main point is that we've had meaningful growth in all geographies, reflecting the product strength and the added tailwind of the holiday season. And looking forward, we would expect typical seasonal patterns to hold to Q4. As you know well, it tends to be our strongest quarter.
Specifically on the US, that as we talked about last quarter, really reflects the diversity of our products here. Each is doing well. Mobile growth, as both Sundar and I talked about, was the key driver yet again.",".

Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: But YouTube and programmatic continue to deliver strong growth, and that translates into the results that you saw for the US. Obviously, we had a nice lift from retail, no surprise given the holiday season.
But I think simply put, it's the diversity doing a lot across a lot of different products. And then in terms of the milestones and your question regarding Other Bets, as I mentioned in opening comments, results this quarter were affected by project milestones. Those milestones were established several years ago, and that's why I called out that it could be lumpy on a quarterly basis and why we look at kind of year over rolling 12 months and not going to break it out in more detail than that.
As Larry said when we announced Alphabet, it's an exciting new chapter.",".

Q: What is the reason for lumpy quarterly results?
A: The reason for lumpy quarterly results is that Alphabet's Other Bets projects have milestone dates that can affect the company's quarterly results."

And so very focused on long term, building that user experience to be assisting users and that's the framework with which we think about it.

                                                   And then in terms of CapEx, you noted the important difference on a year-over-year basis, a couple of sizable real estate items as part of our facilities expansion that we called out last year, on top of continued investment in our technical infrastructure. But really to the heart of your question, looking ahead for 2016, we do expect to see accelerated investment in CapEx and that's to support both Google and Other Bets.
As we often talk about, we view our technical infrastructure as a key strategic asset for the Company. We have terrific scale and efficiency, and the team has done an extraordinary job innovating to achieve efficiencies following a period of heavier investment in 2014.",".

Q: Can you give us an update on the status of your technical infrastructure investments?
A: We continue to make significant investments in our technical infrastructure, which we view as a key strategic asset for the Company. We have terrific scale and efficiency, and the team has done an extraordinary job innovating to achieve efficiencies following a period of heavier investment in 2014."
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: So we're now delivering about three times the compute power for the same amount of power or dollars we did five years ago, and that's an important point because it explains some of the slower CapEx in 2015.
But given our commitment to have the most potent infrastructure, we do expect to increase CapEx in 2016. And for Google, that is intended to continue to support growth in our consumer products and services globally, as well as all that we're doing for our enterprise clients, as Sundar has already talked about. So that CapEx in both areas there.
And then in terms of Fiber and what we're doing more broadly in Other Bets, Fiber will continue to be, we expect, the biggest consumer. And again, you identified the driver of it.",".

What is Alphabet Inc's plan to increase CapEx in 2016?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: It obviously, increases as we execute in a growing number of cities. One of the main things that also affected 2015 is the rollout was really measured as we worked to enhance the construction process and efficiency, doing things like developing relationships with cities and establishing protocol with construction partners. But we have more cities announced and, obviously, as we execute on those that takes more CapEx, as well.

Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: First, Sundar, if you could talk a little about YouTube? It's been several quarters now where you've talked about the mix shift toward true TrueView ads kind of bringing down the average CPC for sites. But can you talk about the trend that you're seeing there more on a like-for-like basis and whether in theory that should tighten up more relative to search ads going forward?
And then, secondly, Ruth, on the core Google business we've seen roughly 300 basis points of margin expansion here over the last year or so. I know you're talking, obviously, about the investments around cloud and machine learning. Do you think there is still potential there for profitability to improve in that segment?

YouTube had very healthy revenue growth, again, driven by growth in TrueView and other video ads, but the monetization story is still evolving. It's still early innings and we're focused on the opportunity to get larger offline budgets moved to YouTube. Given the level of user engagement globally and the compelling nature of demographics it does remain a very attractive platform.
In the near term, given the growth in viewership, YouTube TrueView CPC pricing is expected to continue to affect our overall sites monetization mix. And then in terms of Google and margin outlook, I think, is really what you're getting at. I'll go back to my prior comment.",".

We're in early innings in many areas, and I already referenced back to the framework we used which is to continue to push the frontier within Google, as well to adjacent areas. You named one. We've talked about it on this call. It's very important, Cloud and Apps, and all that we're looking to invest there.

YouTube is doing well because of the progress in the living rooms and the progress of YouTube Red. We're seeing great momentum in the living rooms and we're seeing great progress with YouTube Red. We're going to continue to invest in those products and we're going to continue to grow them. We're seeing good traction with our original scripted content, and we're also seeing good traction with our licensed long-form content. We're seeing good traction with both of those products. We're seeing good traction with our ad products as well. We're seeing good traction with both of those products. We're seeing good traction with both of those products.

What is the Rest-of-World opportunity for Alphabet Inc?"
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: One, just going back to the CPCs real quickly, if we were to sort of normalize out both TrueView and currency, I'm just wondering any comments on how core Search is doing and just how core Mobile Search is doing from a pricing standpoint?
And then, second, just on the CapEx side, I'm just sort of curious how you think about utilization across all of your products, and are we sort of   you, obviously, spent a lot in the past. Are we kind of at a good spot? Do we need to spend ahead or is there a lot of capacity that isn't being utilized right now? Thank you.

Question: How is core Search doing?
Answer: Core Search is doing well, with growth in both organic and paid search traffic. We are spending a lot, but we believe there is a lot of capacity that is not being utilized."
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: - CFO    [40]
                                                   So in terms of CPCs, other than YouTube, I guess the other comments to add are in the fourth quarter, we did see an impact from the ad format changes that we talked about in the third quarter. That also increased our overall click base and we believe this click growth is a positive indicator of ads that are proving to be more relevant to users. In other words, the CPC trend reflects the fact that the denominator is growing faster than the numerator, but we do view that as a long-term upside opportunity for both CPCs and revenue.
So mobile continues to be very healthy. I tried to indicate in my opening comments, and Sundar did as well, and similarly desktop growth remains very healthy.",".

Question: What is the long-term upside opportunity for CPCs and revenue?
Answer: The long-term upside opportunity for CPCs and revenue is that the denominator is growing faster than the numerator."
Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2015 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: In terms of CapEx, so I guess the main point is we do expect that it will be increasing in 2016. I've already addressed that.
I think part of it's   you got in the way you asked the question   which is we've achieved efficiencies after this heavy spend in 2014, and that's where the team was very focused as we ramped up spend. And then we've been focused on what can we   how to extract the most efficiency here, and that as I said, does explain some of the slower CapEx in 2015 and the reason we've been very focused on indicating that it will be increasing to support all that we're doing.
It's quite a bit of requirements on both the Google side and what we're doing in Other Bets and Fiber, specifically.",".

Question: What was the reason for the slower CapEx in 2015?
Answer: The slower CapEx in 2015 was due to the team's focus on achieving efficiencies after spending heavily in 2014."

So is this mostly a function of Mobile Search hitting its stride? Is there anything else that's driving that growth up? And what do you think that says about the maturity, or lack thereof, of digital advertising globally as we look at all other regions? And then you also made the comment during the prepared remarks that ARPU for Play, I believe you're referring to Play, is up 30%.
Is that on a like-for-like geo basis? And is that a function of the personalization efforts that Google's been doing within Play, or is that more a function of just the overall content flowing through Play evolving and maturing? Thank you.",".

                                                   On the first, when I think about growth, you're right, and as Ruth mentioned earlier too, Mobile Search, YouTube, they're all working well. But I would take into account overall a secular shift to mobile, how users are adopting mobile, and on top of that, I think we are working hard to serve our users well on mobile. So it's a combination of all of that and I think the model is working well.
On Play, to be very clear, spend per buyer is up 30% and that's globally. And it's a function of, as you pointed out, I think we have made good strides in terms of personalizing the experience for each user and I think that's borne fruit.",".

You talked about looking at the trend line on a trailing 12-month basis at the Other Bets losses to get a sense of the trend line.

What is Alphabet Inc's CFO's name?
Ruth Porat"
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Our revenue of $21.5 billion in the second quarter underscores the great performance of our businesses globally. For the quarter, our consolidated revenue grew 25% in constant currency versus last year.
Once again, the primary driver was the increased use of mobile search by consumers, benefiting from our ongoing efforts to enhance the mobile search experience. We also benefited from solid growth in desktop and tablet search, as well as continued strength in YouTube and programmatic advertising.
I'm going to present to you in the following order: first, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet. Second, review the results for each of Google and Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook."," for each.

1. Alphabet's consolidated revenue grew 25% in constant currency in the second quarter of 2016. What was the primary driver of this growth?
2. Google's main business is search advertising. How did its revenue grow in the second quarter?
3. Other Bets includes businesses such as Nest, Fiber, and Calico. How did its revenue grow in the second quarter?
4. Alphabet's outlook for the third quarter includes expectations of ""modest revenue growth"" in constant currency. Why is this outlook modest?

1. The primary driver of Alphabet's growth in the second quarter was increased use of mobile search by consumers.
2. Google's main business is search advertising, and its revenue grew in the second quarter due to increased use of mobile search.
3. Other Bets includes businesses such as Nest, Fiber, and Calico, and their revenue grew in the second quarter due to increased use of mobile search and other factors.
4. Alphabet's outlook for the third quarter includes expectations of ""modest revenue growth"" in constant currency. This outlook is modest because there are other factors that could affect the growth of its revenue, such as global economic conditions."
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions.
Beginning with the summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance. Total revenue was $21.5 billion, up 21% year over year, and up 6% sequentially. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year over year of $113 million, or $35 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 25% year over year and increased 5% sequentially.
Once again, Alphabet revenues by geography highlight both the strength of our business around the globe, as well as the impact the currency headwinds continue to have on our non-US business relative to last year. US revenue was up 25% year over year to $10 billion.",".

What was the impact of the currency headwinds on Alphabet's non-US business?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: UK revenue was up 14% year over year to $1.9 billion.
In fixed FX terms, the UK grew 20% year over year. These results do not reflect the movement in the British pound subsequent to the results on the referendum on June 23rd. Rest-of-world revenue was up 19% versus last year to $9.6 billion. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 26% year over year. GAAP other cost of revenues were $4.2 billion. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues, was $3.9 billion, up 28% year over year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. Specifically, costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation; content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube; and hardware costs.
GAAP operating expenses were $7.4 billion in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6.2 billion, or 29% of revenue, up 15% year over year and up 2% versus Q1.",".

What was the main driver of Google-related expenses in the quarter?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by R&D expense mainly due to compensation expense related to head count growth.
On a GAAP basis, operating income was $6 billion, up 24% versus last year. The operating margin was 28%. Non-GAAP operating income was $7.5 billion, up 25% versus last year. The operating margin was 35%. Stock-based compensation totalled $1.5 billion, up 33% year over year and up 1% sequentially, primarily reflecting increased head count and the impact of our senior executive equity refresh that occurs every two years.
Head count at the end of the quarter was 66,575, up 2,460 from last quarter. The vast majority of new hires continue to be engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as cloud and apps.",".

What was the main driver of Alphabet's year-over-year growth?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: On a numbers basis, we are adding more head count in Google, while on a percentage basis, we are growing faster in Other Bets.
Other income and expense was $151 million. As discussed on prior calls, OI&E consists of a number of line items impacted by market factors which makes it inherently unpredictable. We provide more detail on these line items in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 20%. Net income was $4.9 billion on a GAAP and $5.9 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $7 on a GAAP basis and $8.42 on non-GAAP basis.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. CapEx for the quarter was $2.1 billion, the substantial majority of which supported the Google segment.",".

What is the effective tax rate?
The effective tax rate was 20%."
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Operating cash flow was $9.1 billion, with free cash flow of $7 billion.
We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $78.5 billion, of which approximately $48 billion, or 61% is held overseas. This performance reflects our strong operating cash flow, offset by the impact of our share repurchases during the quarter of approximately $1.6 billion, completing the authorization under our share repurchase program.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment, revenue was $21.3 billion, up 21% year over year, which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenue was $15.4 billion in the quarter, up 24% year over year and up 7% sequentially.",".

What was the main driver of Google's revenue growth in the quarter?
The main driver of Google's revenue growth in the quarter was the impact of FX."
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Year-on-year growth reflects substantial strength in mobile search due to the ongoing benefit in improvement in ad formats and delivery that we launched in the third quarter of last year. We continue to have solid growth from desktop and tablet search.
YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView, and increasingly, Google Preferred, with a growing contribution from buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager. Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 3% year on year, and up 1% sequentially, continuing to reflect the strong growth of programmatic offset by the traditional network businesses.
Other revenue for Google was $2.2 billion, up 33% year over year and up 5% sequentially.",".

What was the main driver of growth in Alphabet's other revenue?
The main driver of growth in Alphabet's other revenue was the growth of Google Preferred, which is a programmatic advertising platform."
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Year-over-year growth was driven by cloud and apps as well as Play followed by hardware.
Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. Let me remind you that these metrics are, of course, affected by currency movements.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $4 billion, or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 18% year over year and up 5% sequentially. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was down slightly as a result of a mix shift between sites revenue, which carries lower TAC, and network revenue.",".

Question: What was the main driver of year-over-year growth in Alphabet's advertising businesses?
Answer: Cloud and apps as well as Play followed by hardware."
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: The increase in both sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenue, as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenue, reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
Operating income excluding SBC was $8.3 billion, up 26% versus last year, for an operating margin of 39%. Google stock-based compensation totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter, up 33% year over year. Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $7 billion up 25% versus last year and the operating margin was 33%. CapEx for the quarter was $2.1 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction.
Turning to Other Bets financials. Let me again emphasize that the majority of these efforts are pre-revenue.",".

What is Alphabet's other bet's pre-revenue?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We continue to invest across these opportunities and are doing so in a disciplined way.
We think it remains most instructive to look at them over a longer-time horizon, because as you have seen, quarterly revenues and expenses can be lumpy for three primary reasons. First, they are early stage; second, they represent an aggregation of businesses operating in different industries; and, third, they may be impacted by one-time items like partnership deals.
For the second quarter, Other Bets revenue was $185 million. Reported revenue for Other Bets was primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. Operating loss excluding SPC was $709 million in the second quarter. Including the impact of SBC, operating loss was $859 million.",".

Question: What are the primary reasons quarterly revenues and expenses can be lumpy?
Answer: Quarterly revenues and expenses can be lumpy for three primary reasons: first, they are early stage; second, they represent an aggregation of businesses operating in different industries; and, third, they may be impacted by one-time items like partnership deals."
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Other Bets CapEx was $280 million in Q2, primarily reflecting ongoing investment in our Fiber business.
I'd like to close with a few observations on our key themes. First, regarding revenue. Our Alphabet structure announced nearly a year ago gives us a framework for developing new sources of revenue growth within both Google and in Other Bets in a disciplined way.
You have seen over the past few quarters how our focus on innovation can drive strong revenue growth. We're continually working to enhance the search experience and making changes to our ads formats and tools, guided by substantial user testing.
We have repeatedly highlighted the 3Q 2015 change in format given the meaningful step-up it drove in our revenue growth rate. That benefit is evident again in the second quarter.",".

What was the change in format that drove 3Q 2015 revenue growth?
The change in format that drove 3Q 2015 revenue growth was the change in format from ads served on websites to ads served through Google's ad network."
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: As we have always said, we have been and remain committed to long-term revenue growth through innovation, but the timing and scale of the impact of innovation is inherently difficult to predict.
Second, as to expenses, I've commented many times that our focus on long-term revenue growth does not give us a pass on managing expenses. We invest a lot of time and effort in assessing how to manage for revenue growth, with the utmost respect for the resources deployed and a focus on getting the best return on those resources, recognizing that in some areas secular trends are creating margin headwinds.
As I mentioned last quarter, there are a number of factors driving higher TAC in both our sites and network businesses.",".

What are some of the factors driving higher TAC in both our sites and network businesses?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: For sites TAC, there are a number of factors that contribute to fluctuations, in particular, changes in the relative use of mobile, desktop, and tablet devices. For each of these devices, sites TAC also reflects and inter-related set of factors, including the mix of paid versus organic distribution points, partners, and agreement terms. Over the past year, the shift to mobile has been the primary driver of the increase in sites TAC, because more mobile searches are subject to TAC.
When looking at sites TAC as a percentage of revenue, it is important also to remember that while YouTube advertising revenue is reflected in our sites line, the associated content acquisition costs are included in other cost of revenues, not TAC. In addition, sites revenue includes hedging gains with no associated effect on TAC.",".

What is the primary driver of the increase in sites TAC?
The shift to mobile has been the primary driver of the increase in sites TAC."
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: The growth in network TAC is due to the ongoing adoption of programmatic platforms by advertisers, which are subject to a higher TAC rate.
In operating expenses people are our biggest area of investment. We continue to attract, develop, and retain the best people to drive our businesses forward. As you would expect, head count additions primarily align with our priority areas, such as cloud and apps and machine learning.
Two important points regarding the third quarter. First, you will see the impact in the third quarter of our annual equity refresh for our employees. As you have seen in prior years, the annual refresh results in a sequential step-up in SBC.
Second, headcount growth tends to be seasonally high in Q3 because that is when we bring on new graduates.",".

What is the impact of the annual equity refresh on headcount growth in the third quarter?
The annual equity refresh results in a sequential step-up in SBC."
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: In addition, please keep in mind that our marketing costs are typically weighted more heavily toward the back half of the year due to the holiday season.
Third, regarding CapEx. At Google, the team has been able to drive meaningful efficiencies in planning and operations for our technical infrastructure, which has enabled us to support growing demand at a stable investment level. These efficiencies include improvements in power and server utilization, the use of machine learning and deployment of innovations like our tensor processing unit. With regard to CapEx investments for Other Bets, our Fiber investment continues to be the driver.
Fourth, about our balance sheet. We remain focused on optimizing our capital structure, recognizing the strategic value of our balance sheet.",".

What are the efficiencies that Google has been able to achieve in their technical infrastructure?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We completed Alphabet's $1.7 billion debt exchange in the second quarter, which gives us flexibility, including the ability to using debt financing if appropriate. In light of the interest rate environment, we may opportunistically access the market to term out our commercial paper.
In conclusion, in the second quarter, we delivered very strong revenue growth and improved operating efficiency. These results reflect the tremendous talent and hard work of our teams around the globe. I will now turn the call over to Sundar.                                         
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO    [4]
                                        
Thanks, Ruth. As you heard, we had a very strong second quarter. There is an amazing energy right now with Google. The strength of the quarter is about mobile.",".

Q: What was the main driver of Alphabet's revenue growth in the second quarter?
A: The main driver of Alphabet's revenue growth in the second quarter was mobile."
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: It's transformed the way that people consume information, and Google's products have become essential and much-loved part of their experience.
Our investment in mobile now underlines everything that we do today, from search and YouTube to Android and advertising. Mobile is the engine that drives a person. And now through our deep investments in machine learning and AI, we are building the engine that will drive our future.
Since the last earnings call, we had Google IO, our biggest event of the year, and I also wrote our annual founder's letter. Both of these allowed me to reflect on our past and look to our future.
We are at a pivotal and transformational moment.",".

1. What is Alphabet's investment in mobile?
2. What is Alphabet's investment in machine learning and AI?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Thanks to advancements in machine learning, we have the unique opportunity to take a big step forward for the next 10 years.
In the letter, I wrote about how we think of our investments and our mission. Today, I'll walk through the six sections of the founder's letter and discuss our progress in each area, and then I'll call out three key highlights from the quarter that are driving our advertising business today and into the future.
The first thing I highlighted in the founder's letter was information. At Google's core, we remain focused on making information and knowledge available for everyone. This, of course, starts with search where we now have trillions of searches every year.
We continue to invest in making search smarter and more useful.","

1. What is Alphabet's mission?

Alphabet's mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful."
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: In the US, we recently introduced a voter tool so when you search for register to vote, you'll get a detailed state-by-state guide with information on how to register, requirements, and deadlines.
Our new keyboard for iOS called Gboard is off to a great start. People love the ability to easily search right from the keyboard, swipe to type, and quickly send emojis. After just one year Google Photos is now helping over 200 million people every month organize and search their photos and memories.
At IO, I was excited to share our vision around the Google Assistant. We want to help people get things done in a conversational way across devices and context. This is possible thanks to advances in machine learning, voice and image recognition, and natural language processing, which we have invested in for years.",".
What is Gboard?

Gboard is a keyboard for iOS that allows users to easily search right from the keyboard, swipe to type, and quickly send emojis."
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: You will be able to experience the Google Assistant in products like our new messaging app, Allo, and our voice-activated device Google Home. And we can't wait to show you what else we are working on in this area.
Second, machine learning. As I said, machine learning is the engine that will drive our future, and it's already making our products better and helping users every day. In fact, more than 100 teams are currently using machine learning at Google, from Street View to Gmail to voice search and more.
For example, in search, we use a ranking signal called RankBrain, which relies on deep learning to improve results. It's already enhancing the search experience in 40 languages, and based on user testing, RankBrain can accurately guess which results users will favor with about 80% accuracy.",".

1. What is machine learning?
2. What are some of the uses for machine learning at Google?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Advances like this help us make our search results even more relevant.
Machine learning is also creating an impact in other ways. Just last week, we announced a test that applied DeepMind's machine learning to our own Google data centers, resulting in up to a 40% reduction in the energy we use for [cooling] This will greatly improve efficiency, and when we publish our research, we hope it will enable others to reduce emissions, too.
Third, content. A big part of making information available is making great content accessible, such as on Google Play, YouTube, and the web. Our efforts to make the mobile web better for everyone with accelerated mobile pages, or AMP, has seen phenomenal global momentum.","

What is DeepMind's machine learning test that reduced energy usage in Google data centers by up to 40%?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We now have over 150 million AMP pages in our index, and with over 4 million new ones published every week from nearly 200 countries.
Last week, we announced AMP for Ads, which helps advertisers build fast, simple, and beautiful ads and landing pages. This will help make the mobile web experience much faster for everyone and help fund it more sustainably.
Video is a huge component of digital content and YouTube continues to shine. It's a thriving home for creators, with more than 1,000 creators crossing the thousand subscribers' mark every single day. Our content ID system has now paid out over $2 billion to partners who use the system.
A big part of video, of course, is live, which we have invested in since 2011.","

What is AMP for Ads?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: YouTube is the first major platform that supports live content in 360 degrees, and we recently announced the ability for creators to go live from their phones with a touch of a button.
Earlier in the quarter, we teamed up with BT to live stream the Champions League on Europa League finals on YouTube in the UK. This special event was the UK's biggest ever live stream. All these innovations had a big reason why partner revenue has averaged 50% growth over the last three years.
Fourth, platforms. A key focus is building great computing promise like Chrome, Android, and our new virtual-reality platform Daydream, so that people can have wonderful experiences regardless of the device or screen they are using.",".

Fifth, the cloud. Many tremendous digital experiences are being built in the cloud today, and businesses are working to take advantage of the cloud as part of their digital transformation. We have been integrating our cloud and app start-ups to create more unified solutions for companies large and small, and these efforts are paying off.
We have strong momentum with businesses like Symphony, a secure communication and work-flow platform who recently announced that its cloud computing business is available on the Google cloud platform.","

What is the cloud?

Our data analytics product, BigQuery, helps mobile gaming company, Kabam, store and understand player actions within their games, from monetization and fraud to production bugs and level completion statistics. As I've said, machine learning has been a major focus and a key differentiator for Google, and that's true for our Google cloud customers as well.
This quarter, we introduced tensor processing units, or TPUs, which can deliver an order of magnitude better-optimized performance per watt for machine-learning projects. Google DeepMind's AlphaGo was powered by TPUs, enabling it to process faster and look farther ahead between moves.",".
What is a ""Tensor processing unit?"""
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We are now passing this benefit on to our enterprise customers to supercharge their machine-learning applications.
Just last week we introduced two cloud machine-learning APIs for speech and natural language to help our enterprise customers convert audio to text and easily understand the structure and sentiment of the text in a variety of languages.
We also introduced a new undersea cable system, the highest capacity system ever built, which brings added capacity and performance to support our enterprise customers around the globe.

Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: To give you a sense of the impact, in Indonesia alone, we have seen growth in monthly buyers quadruple in the last 18 months.
Switching gears from these six areas, it is our business success that enables us and our partners to grow and invest further. We are extraordinarily well positioned to take advantage of the mobile shift, and we are already seen strong growth in three key areas of our advertising business: mobile search, video, and programmatic. All of the momentum you're seeing is because our products are doing well in mobile and our customers are getting great results from them.
We offer advertisers and agencies the best ways to reach customers at the right moment of intent, the best reach in inventory, the best mobile formats, and the leading measurement solutions.",".

What is the impact of the mobile shift on Alphabet's advertising business?
The impact of the mobile shift on Alphabet's advertising business is that it is seeing strong growth in three key areas: mobile search, video, and programmatic."
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Of course, we do all of this while making sure we are creating a great [ads] experience for users that is helpful and unobtrusive.
We know that people are constantly searching for things with commercial intent and are used to swiping and tapping. Our data shows that people respond really well to the ads we show. They are fresh, fast, and useful.
So let me turn to three key moments from the quarter for our advertising business. Number one, our Google Performance Summit for direct response marketers. We announced new expanded text ads and bit adjustments by device type, which are rolling out this week, as well as new local search ads in Google Maps.
Thanks to the rise in mobile phones, the line between online and offline experiences continues to blur.",".

1. What is the Google Performance Summit for direct response marketers?
2. What are the new expanded text ads and bit adjustments by device type?
3. What is new in local search ads in Google Maps?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: This creates even greater opportunity for businesses to use Google Maps to help bring customers into their physical store locations. Thanks to our strong intent signals, particularly on mobile, Google continues to offer great opportunities for direct response marketers to reach potential customers, whether they are visiting your website, calling your business, walking into your store, or downloading your app.
For instance, Walgreen's partnered closely with Google to promote their app across search, Google Play and our display networks. In one month, they increased the number of app downloads 87% from the previous month.
Number two, our annual Brandcast event for brand advertisers was a huge success.",".

What was Walgreen's partnership with Google?
What was Walgreen's success with their Brandcast event?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We announced Breakout Videos, the ability to advertise against fast-rising videos on YouTube; as well as a deal with the NBA to bring their inventory to Google Preferred.
As this point, the volume of Google Preferred bought this year is already more than double what it was at the same time last year. Fast-food chain Wendy's used Google Preferred to extend the reach of their TV ads, and thanks to our Brand Lift measurement solution, they were able to see that one of their campaigns drove an incredible 65% lift in ad recall and 146% lift in Google searches for the Wendy's brand.",".

Question: What is the deal with the NBA?
Answer: The deal with the NBA is to bring their inventory to Google Preferred, which is a program that allows advertisers to have their ads shown on the highest quality videos on YouTube."
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We are hearing a lot of the same feedback from many top brands who continue to invest more and more of their budgets on YouTube.
And number three our DoubleClick Leadership Summit held just last week for ad technology partners. We launched the ability to buy native ads programmatically across all screens in DoubleClick Bid Manager. [Since we're] providing fully designed creatives for each publisher, advertisers can simply upload the components of the ad, like headline, image and text, and double-click automatically a simples stamp to fit the context and format of the site or app where they appear.
Making native advertising simple at this scale will help to make ads faster, better, and less intrusive while driving great returns for publishers. So there's my top three moments from my advertising business this quarter."," for each.

1. What is the name of the ad technology partner that launched the ability to buy native ads programmatically across all screens in DoubleClick Bid Manager?

Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: As you can see, it has been extremely busy.
More generally, from advertising to cloud to digital content to hardware and to so much more, we have tremendous long-term growth opportunities at Google. Today's great innovations are being driven by our investments in mobile; tomorrow's will be driven from our investments in machine learning and new computing platforms. But one thing is constant; we'll continue to focus on building the best experiences for billions of people around the world.
I want to thank all of the Googlers around the world who help us create these opportunities every day and help them bring to life for our users and partners. With that, I'll turn it back over to Ruth.

Carlos Kirjner, Bernstein.                                         
Carlos Kirjner,  Bernstein - Analyst    [2]
                                        
Thank you. I have two questions. First, is about Search revenues. Search is probably a $50-billion business, and from today's results, it's clearly still growing strongly. Of course, if the business gets larger, it becomes harder and harder to sustain growth. As you look at this increasing growth challenge on your product innovations in Search, including recent changes and also those that you have in your road map for the next few years, how do you think about your ability to sustain such revenue growth and the trajectory for which they will ultimately accelerate?
The second questions is on Google Fiber.",".

Carlos Kirjner, Bernstein - Analyst                                           
Thank you. I have one question and an answer. The question is about the growth challenge in Search and how you are addressing it. The answer is that you are continuing to make product innovations, including recent changes, and you have a road map for the next few years that includes additional product innovations. This will help address the growth challenge."
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: I think Ruth has been quite clear that we should expect an increasing Other Bets CapEx, and that Fiber is the main driver, suggesting more investment. Yet when we see the rate at which you have deployed in markets like Austin or some of the newer markets, they are quite slow.
You also have started to talk about wireless technologies, suggesting that you haven't fully figured this out yet, which in turn suggests that it's going to be slow to [climb]. So the question is, which one is it? Is it faster, more aggressive deployment given the CapEx commentary or is it going to be continued slow, multi-year deployment as your track record and the talk of new technologies suggest? Thank you.                                         
Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - CFO    [3]
                                        
Thank you, Carlos, a lot in those questions."," for that question.

What is Alphabet Inc.'s plan for increasing Other Bets CapEx?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Starting with sites revenue and where we see the opportunities there, obviously, sites revenue up 24% year on year includes the currency impact. And as Sundar and I both commented on, the biggest driver again this quarter was mobile search.","

What was the biggest driver of Alphabet Inc's sites revenue growth in Q2 2016?

The biggest driver of Alphabet Inc's sites revenue growth in Q2 2016 was mobile search."
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We do continue to have solid growth in desktop, tablet, we have strength in YouTube, particularly video advertising, both in our TrueView products and increasingly from Google Preferred.
As we've talked about every quarter since the third quarter of last year, we have benefited to the change to ad formats on mobile that we made in the third quarter of last year, and that is evident yet again this quarter.
And then as per your question, when we go back   going back to that third quarter of 2015 when we made the change in ad formats on mobile, our growth rate meaningfully accelerated.","

What was the change in ad formats on mobile that Alphabet Inc made in the third quarter of last year?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: And as we've noted in each subsequent quarter, that change has been the primary driver of the higher year-on-year revenue growth rate.
But importantly, as you've seen over the last several quarters, we're benefiting not just from the higher growth rate but also from the durability of the impact of the change. So that's really underscoring the efficacy of these ads for users, as per Sundar's comments, and it's reflected in revenues running at a higher level. And you can see where the revenue growth rate was prior to the third quarter introduction; I'll let you do your own forecasting. But when comparing growth rates, we're obviously at a higher revenue base versus last year.
And then Sundar talked about some of the recent events that we've had. Innovation is core to everything we're doing.",".

What is the primary driver of the higher year-on-year revenue growth rate? The higher growth rate is due to the impact of the change, which is also being sustained."
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We've launched several changes to ad formats and tools just a few days ago. As the team discussed at the Google Performance Summit, we believe the changes should result in a better, more useful experience for users and better performance for advertisers. And so that just continues to be core to the way we're looking at the business with a lot of incremental opportunity.
And then on your Fiber   the Fiber and the CapEx question, look, we continue to see Fiber as a huge market opportunity. We're focused on creating abundant connectivity, networks that are always fast and always open, as we've talked about. And we're continuing to work closely with cities given their excitement.","

What are the changes to ad formats and tools that Alphabet Inc. has just launched?

The changes aim to improve the user experience and performance for advertisers."
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We're also looking to push the frontier with tech innovation, as you noted in your question, and different execution paths.
So, as you said in the question, we're exploring both Fiber and wireless and you may have seen our recent acquisition of WebPass. So we want to make sure we're executing against a very large and attractive market in the most effective and efficient manner. We did start adding customers in Charlotte in July, and so again, we view it as a big opportunity. We're being thoughtful and deliberate in our execution path.

2. What are Alphabet's plans for expanding its search business?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: I wanted to go a little deeper on the retail and the travel verticals; it's two areas where we see a lot of innovation from the Company right now, both on the product side that consumers are seeing, as well as on the advertising side. How should we think about the road map ahead for both increased user engagement with your product in those key verticals, as well as ability for advertiser conversion to lead to more advertising budgets for the Company over the medium to long term?
And then maybe one second question would be, with the buy-back authorization having been completed this quarter, Ruth, would love to get your thoughts how you're thinking about the balance sheet as an asset and how shareholders should think about ability for shareholder returns over the medium and long term.",".

What are your thoughts on the road map for increased user engagement and advertiser conversion in the retail and travel verticals?

So why don't I start on your second question, then I'll pass it to Sundar on the first question. As you know, we announced the share repurchase program relatively recently, it was just in the third quarter of last year, and we just completed it, as per my opening comments. As we discussed back in the third quarter, we do always review our balance sheet and capital requirements and opportunities with our Board. And I'm not going to speculate about a potential for a future Board decision, so really nothing more to add at this point. And then, Sundar?                                         
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO    [7]
                                        
Look, we obviously think generally across all types of verticals, and you highlighted a couple of important verticals."," for each of the following:

1. What is Alphabet Inc.'s strategy for generating revenue from its Google properties?

2. What is Alphabet Inc.'s strategy for generating revenue from its other businesses?

3. What is Alphabet Inc.'s strategy for generating revenue from its Google Fiber business?

4. What is Alphabet Inc.'s strategy for generating revenue from its other businesses?

1. Alphabet Inc.'s strategy for generating revenue from its Google properties is to continue to grow advertising revenue and to increase YouTube viewership.
2. Alphabet Inc.'s strategy for generating revenue from its other businesses is to increase sales from its Google Ventures and Google Capital investments, as well as from its other businesses.
3. Alphabet Inc.'s strategy for generating revenue from its Google Fiber business is to increase the number of subscribers.
4. Alphabet Inc.'s strategy for generating revenue from its other businesses is to increase the number of active users."
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: To give an example on travel, many users start their travel inquiry on Google. And so we focus on doing a better job on getting them deeper information, new destinations and compare costs through new features in hotel search, Google flights, and the recently launched Destinations on Google.
In all of this we work closely with many different partners, including online travel agencies, and so we focus on product enhancements in partnership with them. The better job we do at answering user queries, the more qualified leads we can provide to our partners, and we think it's a win-win arrangement. And so, and the same concept applies to these other verticals as well, so we approach it very holistically.

Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Sundar, I was wondering, I know you gave us some color on the cloud business just a few moments ago in your prepared remarks. But I was wondering if you could share with us some of the changes, if you could highlight some of them that Diane had made since she's come on board. And I'm wondering how some of those changes might be starting to impact conversations with potential customers that you're having. And, in particular, just trying to get a sense of are you seeing Google now with GCP getting invited to more RFPs and starting to see your win rates go up as a result of some of her initiatives?

Question: What changes, if any, has Diane Smith made at Alphabet since she joined the company?
Answer: Smith has made changes to the company's cloud business, which is starting to impact Alphabet's conversations with potential customers."
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Absolutely, I think that Diane has initiated a set of changes, and essentially, she has integrated our go-to-market strategy with her engineering and product efforts. She has integrated our engineering efforts on the cloud. So for example, Google Apps, Drive, Docs, Gmail, Slides Sheets, Hangouts, et cetera, is on top of the cloud stack.
Our enterprise customers and partners, for them, now they have one enterprise [phase], and internally, from frictionless contracts to touch points across Google, to one person to work with them on our considerable enterprise technologies and products. So the big unifying one being cloud.
We now have new leadership in place across sales, professional services, marketing, and partnering, plus new customer-facing support in the form of professional services.",".

Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We have an office of the CTO and customer reliability.
So it's a big set of changes, and it's obviously having an impact. Many of our customers are also partners, and so it's increasingly clear how much we can do together. So for me I see a shift to a world-class enterprise approach, and it's definitely having an impact on the type of conversations we are having and the outcome of the RFPs we are engaged in.

And you guys have mentioned things like reducing the error rates in search, and improving relevancy. But are there tangible examples of either engagement or volume also increasing as you roll out machine learning in search and in YouTube that you could share?
And then I think Google recently introduced Smart Bidding in AdWords using machine learning. So do you see something like this as a potential revenue driver? Any color there would be great. Thank you.

Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: To give a specific example you asked about YouTube. YouTube watch time is something that we focus on. We use machine learning increasingly to give recommendations to users when they're watching a video in terms of what they could watch next. And that recommendation system is getting   increasingly using machine learning, and that directly drives engagement. So there are several such examples I can give across the Company.
You mention AdWords, too. If you look at AdWords and thoughtful changes we do, over time, we are dealing with big [commentary] of space in terms of the kinds of changes and interactions that can happen. So deploying machine learning there over time, over many years I think is a more powerful and deeper way to explore the various possibilities that exist and I think will lead to long-term impacts.",".

On the first one, we obviously, over many, many years we always put users first, and as we present our search results, we have long-term metrics for user happiness around which we make   that's the framework for all of the changes we make. Obviously with the shift to mobile, the user experience   users are evolving in terms of how they use our product. And with that as a guidance, we have made changes.
We make many, many changes,, and I would look at it holistically. And even some of the changes you're talking about affect certain highly commercial queries where users are actually looking for that commercial information. So the metrics is what drives how we change these things, and I'm being very, very thoughtful about it.",".

On YouTube, I think about it as we are seeing strong growth. I mentioned the momentum behind Google Preferred and how we are double the rate we were last year. So to me, that implies strong growth. It's tough for us to assess from TV or just advertisers in listing more because [of this traction] in YouTube. But we just see strong momentum. And as far as today, just look at how users are using mobile, videos, the killer format on mobile, and I think that is what gives us the secular trend moving forward.

I just want to ask one question. It has to do with mobile search and I want to throw an idea by you, which is we've been going through this mobile transition for four or five years. Consumers have, I think, dramatically led businesses and advertisers to mobile devices.

As we have had this shift to mobile that our second [order effects, which] kick in too, which is why when you look at our ad improvements and our revenue improvements I would focus more holistically.

Good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, I was wondering if you could spend a little time talking about the launch of the My Activity site, which I think is an update to the controls that your users have over the use of their data. And, in particular, I would be interested to hear about the option to opt into greater personalization of ads from across usership on Google sites.",".

Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: As I believe that's the first time you've allowed on an opt-in basis certainly, to have search data be used to target ads elsewhere.
And then maybe as a follow-up to that what you're seeing in terms of early traction of users turning that on and where your expectations for that may be.                                         
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO    [24]

For people who choose to opt in over time, we could make sure they see more relevant ads and fewer annoying ones, so effectively put them in better control of the experience they get. And so I think that helps the whole ecosystem work better. We are in very, very early days and   but we're thoughtful about how we do this for users.

The main benefit of opting-in to ads is that users could see more relevant ads and fewer annoying ones."
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: First off, we understand that Google Shopping in particular continues to see strong growth, and I was hoping you could add color on relative mix or growth rates of PLA contrasting with other ad types, along with the adoption of the transactional capabilities.
And then, Sundar, I wanted to follow up on some of the conversational and voice applications and devices that you have in the pipeline. And more generally, how you envision voice really fitting in across the board, across the Google platform. Will this be a centerpiece as you also utilize machine learning, artificial intelligence? I'd like to hear more about your vision for that. Thank you.

Question: What is Alphabet Inc.'s vision for voice?
Answer: Alphabet Inc.'s vision for voice is to use it across the Google platform to help people interact with the internet in new ways."

Let me, quickly on the first one, we don't comment on the relative mix, et cetera, so I'll probably give more color on your second question. Voice is obviously very, very exciting for us. I mentioned this at IO, if you look at the Android, the Google app on Android in the US, 20% of the queries are voice queries.
Today, in terms of evolving to a conversational assistant, we have a big head start, people do this. We get millions of queries every single day, and it's incredibly exciting to see how people interact with voice differently from text.",".

What is Alphabet Inc's strategy for generating revenue from voice queries?"
Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: It's more intuitive, it's more personal, and it's a bit more emotional and engaging experience for users.
And so, I think to do this well requires deep computer science, understanding what they are saying, the natural language processing involved. These are areas in which we have now been working for over 15 years, and we believe we are the best in class. Bringing all of that together I think is what will help us do this at scale globally.
But it's still very early days in terms of getting the conversational assistant right. You will see us launch this throughout products as we go through the second half of this year, and I am excited to see how users respond to it.

Thanks for taking my questions. I have one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, in terms of messaging, you mentioned Allo, your mobile messaging product, and Duo, which is a   your video messaging product. Why is it important that Google is competitive in mobile messaging, and what gives you the confidence that you could take market share from the other players in the messaging space?
And then, Ruth, in terms of the driver of YouTube growth, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that one of the drivers was buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager. I just want to maybe hear a little bit more about that. Why has that been so successful recently and do you look at that as an incremental, forward driver of YouTube growth?

On your first question, I think messaging is obviously an important area. We approach these areas, if you believe we have insights by which we can create something very differentiated for users, that they're actually approaching it in a new and unique way. The core underlying insight we have is in the context of mobile and using a state-of-the-art machine learning, can we rethink some of these areas for our users?
That's the underlying framework with which we've approached this space. I've been really enjoying using these products, and we'll get it out to users soon. For example, I think if you take something like Duo today, I think especially on Android, high quality messaging is an experience that's still lacking for users. So we clearly see an opportunity there.",".

And the focus here for us is we're solving a really big need, safety, access and city efficiency.
The thing that's really motivating for us is when you look at over 30,000 car deaths in the US alone, that's what really inspired the founders to start working on this issue.

And every indication we see is that the growth is very, very strong, being driven by mobile and it's growing globally, as well. So overall, I think engagement is very, very healthy. I'm pretty excited about it.

For the quarter, our consolidated revenue grew 23% in constant currency versus last year, notwithstanding a challenging year-on-year comparison.

Operating cash flow was $9.8 billion, with free cash flow of $7.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $83.1 billion, of which approximately $50 billion or 60% is held overseas. 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment, revenue was $22.3 billion, up 20% year over year, which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was $16.1 billion in the quarter, up 23% year over year, and up 4% sequentially. Year-on-year growth reflects strength in mobile search.",".

Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.2 billion or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 17% year over year, and up 5% sequentially. The increase in both sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenue, as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenue, reflects the fact our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up slightly sequentially, as a result of higher TAC for mobile search, offsetting the benefits of a revenue mix shift from network to sites. 
Operating income excluding SBC was $8.4 billion, up 19% versus last year, for an operating margin of 38%. Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.6 billion for the quarter, up 28% year over year.",".

CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction. 
Turning to Other Bets, as we have said previously we think it remains most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer time horizon, because as you have seen, quarterly revenues and expenses can be lumpy for three primary reasons: First, the Other Bets are  early stage. Second, they represent an aggregation of businesses operating in different industries. And finally, they maybe impacted by one-time items like partnership deals. 
For the third quarter, Other Bets revenue was $197 million, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. Operating loss, excluding SBC, was $665 million in the third quarter.",".

Question: What is the long-term outlook for Other Bets?
Answer: The Other Bets revenue and operating loss are lumpy because they are early stage businesses that represent an aggregation of businesses operating in different industries. The long-term outlook is to grow these businesses and generate more recurring revenue."
Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Including the impact of SBC, operating loss was $865 million. Other Bets' CapEx was $324 million in Q3, primarily reflecting ongoing investment in our Fiber business. 
I'd like to close with a few observations on our progress since the creation of Alphabet just over a year ago, as well as a review of our key themes. As we've frequently noted, our move to Alphabet was motivated by our belief that revolutionary ideas drive the next big growth areas. Long-term success requires a commitment to making bets, putting the right talent and resources behind those bets, and remaining flexible and dynamic as we pursue them. We believe our structure provides the transparency and oversight needed to make smart choices about our investment opportunities, both within Google and across Other Bets.",".

Question: What is the main reason for Alphabet's creation?
Answer: The main reason for Alphabet's creation was to pursue innovative ideas and to put the right talent and resources behind those bets."
Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: 
As we reach for moon shots that will have a big impact in the longer term, it's inevitable that will be course corrections along the way, and that some efforts will be more successful than others. Over the past year for example, you  have seen us make progress and accelerate our efforts in some areas, while repositioning or taking a pause in others. We are taking the steps necessary to the lay the foundation for a stronger future. 
Looking ahead, first regarding revenue, our revenue growth reflects our sustained investment in innovation. Within Google, this relentless focus has led to innovations across our advertising platforms, that have driven continued strong growth on a very large base, while at the same time we are building new businesses to serve as sources of future revenue growth.",".

Question: What is Alphabet's strategy for generating future revenue growth?
Answer: Alphabet's strategy for generating future revenue growth is to focus on innovations across their advertising platforms and new businesses."
Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: 
Most notably, Google Cloud is generating substantial revenue growth reflecting the ongoing momentum in the business, as well as the enormous opportunity in this area. And earlier this month, we launched a new line of hardware devices that for the first time brings consumers the best of Google, through both hardware and software developed by Google. As discussed previously, because most of our Other Bets are pre-revenue, the other bet revenue line provides only partial insight regarding our progress, which we aim to supplement with insight   regarding product progress. 
For example, at Nest, product innovations and improvements including the new outdoor version of the Nest Cam are leading to increased consumer adoption of its suite of products for the home.",".

What is the Other Bets revenue line for Alphabet Inc?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Our self-driving car team is making terrific progress in transforming mobility, with our fleet of test cars recently passing the 2 million mile  mark of autonomous driving. We are now testing our cars in four cities, enabling us to experience varied weather and driving conditions. 
Second, as to expenses. As I mentioned last quarter, there are a number of factors driving higher TAC in both our sites and network businesses, and those factors persisted in the third quarter. The shift to mobile in Q3 remained the largest driver of the increase in sites TAC as a percentage of revenue. 
We expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of sites revenue.",".

What is the largest driver of the increase in sites TAC as a percentage of revenue?
The shift to mobile in Q3 remained the largest driver of the increase in sites TAC as a percentage of revenue."
Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: The growth in network TAC in Q3 was due to the ongoing adoption of programmatic platforms by advertisers, which are subject to a higher TAC rate, a trend we expect to continue. Furthermore, with respect to Google's operating expenses, we remain committed to investing in the compelling opportunities we've identified. 
Turning to Other Bets. We're building out these businesses systematically and thoughtfully, investing commensurate with requirements given the opportunities we see. Before moving on from expenses, one reminder regarding the fourth quarter: 
As discussed in prior years, our marketing costs are typically weighted more heavily toward the back half of the year, due  to the holiday season. Relative to last year, we have expanded portfolio of hardware products and therefore expect marketing cost to increase in the fourth quarter to support the line. 
Third, regarding CapEx.",":

What is the TAC rate for programmatic platforms?
The TAC rate for programmatic platforms is higher than the TAC rate for other platforms."
Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: At Google, the team continues to drive meaningful efficiencies in planning and operations for our technical infrastructure. With regard to CapEx investments for Other Bets, our fiber investment remains the primary driver. 
Fourth, our balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains a powerful tool reflecting the strength of our cash flow, and thereby giving us the ability to invest aggressively to support our long-term growth. Our primary focus is just that, investing in the breadth of opportunities across Alphabet. And as discussed previously, our capital allocation framework begins with our outlook for the businesses, including a sensitivity analysis regarding potential CapEx and M&A, as well as view regarding working capital, and a prudent liquidity buffer. 
This framework further considers complementary uses, such as a share repurchase.",".

What is the primary driver of Alphabet's CapEx investments for Other Bets?
The primary driver of Alphabet's CapEx investments for Other Bets is their fiber investment."
Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: As announced today, our Board has authorized us to commence a repurchase of our Class C capital stock of up to $7.01934097683 billion. 
In conclusion, in the third quarter, we again delivered strong revenue growth, while broadening our portfolio of products and services. Thanks to all of our colleagues around the globe, for their ingenuity and passion for pushing the frontier. I'll turn the call over to Sundar.                                          
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO - Google Inc.    [4]
                                        
 Thanks, Ruth.  I don't think I can remember a busier time in Google's history in the past few months. We introduced the world to the Google Assistant, powered by our state-of-the-art machine learning technology. 
We unveiled a beautiful line-up of new hardware devices, including Google Home and the Pixel Phone, which is getting great reviews.",".

What was the Google Assistant?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We launched a new messaging app, Allo, and a new video chat app, Duo. It's been an incredible quarter. 
Through it all, we are laser focused on the priorities I outlined earlier this year, and in the next few minutes, I will quickly go through our progress this past quarter. We feel well-positioned as we transition to a new era of computing. This new era is one in which people will experience computing more naturally and seamlessly, in the context of their lives, powered by intelligent assistants and the Cloud. This transition is as significant as the move over the last decade from desktops to mobile devices. 
As we have rolled out products like the Google Assistant, Pixel, Google Home, and Allo, we have gotten a glimpse of that  future.",".

What is the ""new era of computing?"""
Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: And with our growing crowd business, we are helping our enterprise customers take advantage of this new era of computing, as well. 
Today, I want to walk through our progress across Google's key focus areas, and the success of our growing advertising business. First, making knowledge and information accessible to everyone. We have long aimed to help people find the information that they want, right when they need it, and sometimes even before they think to ask for it. 
We reached an important milestone in the journey this quarter, with the launch of the Google Assistant, which allows you to type or talk with Google in a natural conversational way, to help you get things done, regardless of the device you are using. We first introduced it in our smart messaging app, Allo, which lets you chat with the Assistant.",: Alphabet Inc. is focusing on making information accessible to everyone through the launch of the Google Assistant.
Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: You can even add it to a group  conversation to help you and your friends decide where to go for dinner. 
Early adoption of Allo and Duo has been great, and has exceeded our expectations. And the Assistant is core to the Pixel phone and Google Home. With Google Home, you can ask the Assistant to cast the salt your living room speaker, or turn on the lights in your kitchen. 
And with Pixel, by simply  holding the Home button, you can ask the Assistant to send a text to your mom, or pull up pictures of your cat in Google Photos. I hope you all get to try them out soon. The Assistant is simple, easy to use, and it is just the beginning. It's going to get so much better.",".

What is the Assistant?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: 
We are excited to bring new features to you across more of your contacts, soon. The Assistant is all possible thanks to our years of investments in computer science and machine learning. Our knowledge graph now understands over 70 billion facts about people, places, and things in the real world. And just last month, we announced our latest research on neural nets, which has given us a huge leap in translation quality.

They have found conversion rates to be twice as high with hotel ads, compared to regular mobile traffic, which is helping them capitalize on those prime time moments when travelers are on their phones and ready to book.

In fact, across our advertising business, measurement is a critical investment. We want to give marketers the best tools out there to close the loop, between television and digital, online and off-line. 
For example, global retailer IKEA, with their agency iProspect UK, used our store visits measurement tools to see how effective their digital marketing campaigns were at bringing shoppers into their stores. By incorporating store visit data, they realized that more than 10% of the people who clicked on their search ads went on to visit a physical store, and that their ROI from online ads was actually five times higher than they had previously estimated.",".

Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: So scaling up through partnerships is a big area of focus and investment for us. We are also establishing a large Cloud machine learning group, so that we can take advantage of working with our Cloud customers, and make machine learning more accessible to all of them. I would say other areas are hiring across sales, engineering and marketing. And as we head into 2017, I expect Cloud to be of our largest areas of investment and headcount growth.

Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call:  I guess, I was wondering Sundar, if you could share with us what  milestones should we be watching for in this business? And then also if you had to characterize, you mentioned a couple of different ones, but I'm wondering what type of workloads are you having most success with in GCP, and  what's on your customers wish lists? What are the things, what's the top one or two things that your enterprise customers for Cloud might be asking for? Thanks

So from a customer standpoint, they will want to use an open source workload management product, and communities can work with multiple customers.

Ross Sandler,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [10]
                                        
Two questions.  Sundar, first on the Alphabet  structure high level, so there's been some incredible innovation that's come out of Alphabet at the various businesses.",".

What is the innovation that has come out of Alphabet at the various businesses?"
Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: If we look at something like Auto, which was acquired by Uber, or Niantic, which was the old Google Maps team, those were teams that were inside working so inside of Google better left Alphabet to start a new company, and could have been potentially wholly-owned businesses as Google in a parallel universe. So do you think the structure is ideal for entire companies, or is it just new products and new technologies, that you see as the vision here for Alphabet long-term? 
And then Ruth, the second question, just on core operating margins for Google declined a little bit versus the prior quarter trend of increasing. Can you just give some color on how much of that was due to mix towards Cloud and other things that might carry lower margin versus margin compression within the advertising business? Thank you.",".

Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO - Google Inc.    [11]
                                        
Ross, on  the first question I would say overall, when you look across Google and Alphabet, the number of areas where we been able to build world-class products and achieve scale and success, we have over seven products which serve 1 billion users each, so I think our track record speaks there. And we generally want to create the culture of innovation, and that's what we focus on. And I think it's very fine that some of them happen outside, so we don't view it as a zero-sum game, and we're very comfortable with how we approach it.

And then in terms of the margin trends, so overall operating margins year on year are up modestly on both the GAAP  and non-GAAP basis, and that primarily reflects trends in Other Bets. I think your question was probably more within  Google, the operating margin on a non-GAAP basis is down modestly year on year, that's primarily to other cost of sales, as distinct from TAC. The Google GAAP operating margins year on year and quarter on quarter do reflect the impact of the equity refresh that we called out last quarter, that I talked about.",".

Question: Can you give us a little more color on the Other Bets margin trends?
Answer: So Other Bets margin trends reflect primarily trends in Other Cost of Sales, which includes costs associated with our investments in hardware, software, and other strategic initiatives."
Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: 
I think one of the core things to your question is just as how we are looking at it, and our view continues to be that given the breadth of opportunities, and our commitment to long-term revenue growth, as we have talked about quarter after quarter, we do remain committed to investing in this growing set of opportunities, and we spend a lot of time trying to manage that revenue growth, and as I've said, manage expense growth with this   the utmost respect for the resources deployed, and getting the best return on those resources. 
So there are number of different factors in here.  I think I mentioned one of the things as you're looking forward was the sales and marketing.",".

What is Alphabet Inc's view on its ability to generate long-term revenue growth?

Alphabet Inc believes that it can continue to grow its revenue over the long term by investing in a growing set of opportunities and managing expenses prudently."
Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: And just to make another point, which I said in my opening comments, we do expect ongoing gross margin pressure from higher TAC in association with mobile search and with programmatic. That does still result in more revenue and gross profit dollars, but at a lower margin, and that's the other really important point, our starting point. We are continuing to invest, and we will point you to the revenue and gross profit dollars that come from that.

That's a good question. Today, a big part of what you are seeing with our transition to mobile that's working really well, the reason mobile search and mobile monetization works really well for us is because a lot of it is inherently local by nature.

I wanted to ask one about Voice. Sundar, you have talked  about the success you've had in improving your natural language recognition, and we know that Voice queries are growing quickly.

Thanks, Peter. From my standpoint, I look at it as, and if you look back in time, all this is   computing is becoming more important to people, so they are engaging with it more and more. So as we went from desktops to mobile, it's not like one replaced the other. The sum total of all of this, it expanded the pie.  I approach this the same way, I think, as I see people using Voice, et cetera. They are interacting more with computing and with Google, too.",".

On the first question, I think I briefly answered it before. In terms of we're thinking about the Voice experience deeply end to end. A lot of it is going,   because of how we are approaching our core investments, both from a software and hardware standpoint, so we leverage it all to make it better.  So for example, even things like TPUs, which we talked about of Google I/O, played a role into something like Voice search you're talking about.",".

On the second question, I think we're seeing a lot of improvement in click-through rates. I don't have an update on the specific numbers, but I think it's something that we're seeing across a lot of our products."
Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: 
And as we evolve the Google Assistant, I think Voice is going to play a major role that way as well. So we are in very early days of all of this, in relation to our overall volumes we see, and so I think we will be thoughtful about it. For example, the Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the voice experience. So it's early days, and I think we will evolve a lot  in the coming years. 
In terms of your second question around expanded text ads, I would say, again it's early. It's been adopted by advertisers across the board.",".

And then my second question is either for Ruth or Sundar, could you talk about the decision to pause efforts for Google Fiber? Wondering, was that decision more about financial discipline as you, I think, explained, Ruth, in your prepared remarks for the Other Bets.

First, the ongoing our ongoing focus on improving the experience for advertisers and users. And we introduced a number of enhancements including format changes and ad totals.  I think the most important point is that no one enhancement came close to   the magnitude of the changes that we made the third quarter of last year.  That's why we kept calling out the 2015 change. And what's been gratifying is, in the aggregate, the results reflect the benefit of ongoing innovation, but very importantly, it wasn't one particular item. 
The second contributor is the secular shift to mobile, and we continue to benefit from that, be an important part of enhancing opportunities for engagement.",".

Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: As we look forward to the fourth quarter, I think that was part of your question, as well.  I think the only thing to point out is that in looking at growth rates, we're obviously at a  revenue growth base versus last year, so just that to us is an important point to   maybe obvious, but important to note there.

The team had some important breakthroughs in new technologies. You noted the most important in our view, all that we are doing with wireless, but also technologies that are key to  implementation. And we believe that both of those, a number of things that are doing to enhance both our effectiveness and efficiency.

Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - CFO and SVP    [3]
                                                   Thank you, Ellen. Our revenues of $24.8 billion in the first quarter demonstrate our broad-based strength globally, with revenues up 22% year-on-year.",".

Question: What was the main driver of Alphabet's 22% year-on-year revenue growth?
Answer: The main driver of Alphabet's 22% year-on-year revenue growth was the continued growth of our advertising revenues."
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: In constant currency, our consolidated revenues grew 24% versus 1Q '16.
Growth in advertising revenues was again driven by mobile search with ongoing strength in YouTube and programmatic. We also had substantial growth in other revenues from Play, hardware and cloud.
Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet. Given the obvious seasonality in Q4, I will focus on year-over-year changes in our results.
As a reminder, I will review our results on a GAAP basis, which includes stock-based compensation for operating income, net income and earnings per share. Second, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook.",".

What was the 24% increase in consolidated revenues compared to 1Q '16?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Sundar will then discuss our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take questions.
Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenues were $24.8 billion, up 22% year-over-year. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $304 million, or $87 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenues grew 24% year-over-year.
Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography. As you can see in our press release, we've enhanced the geographic split to give you more insight into our businesses around the world. We are now reporting our revenues in 4 regions: The U.S.; EMEA, namely Europe, Middle East and Africa; APAC or Asia Pacific; and other Americas, which encompasses Canada and Latin America.",".

Question: What was the main driver of Alphabet's revenue growth in the quarter?
Answer: The main driver of Alphabet's revenue growth in the quarter was the continued growth of our advertising business."
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: To help you with the transition to our new geographic reporting, we're also sharing the U.K. revenues for this quarter. These groupings align more closely with how we manage our businesses, and also with the major currencies that affect our results. The results by region highlight the strength of our business around the globe.
U.S. revenues were up 25% year-over-year to $11.8 billion. EMEA revenues were $8.1 billion, up 13% year-over-year. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 19%. U.K.-reported revenues continue to reflect the ongoing weakness of the British pound, with revenues up 5% year-over-year to $2 billion on a reported basis, yet up 16% in fixed FX terms. APAC revenues were $3.6 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 26% in fixed FX terms, reflecting strength of the Australian dollar and yen.",".

What was the U.K. revenue for this quarter?
The U.K. revenue for this quarter was $2 billion."
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Other Americas revenues, which include results from Canada and Latin America, were up 34% versus last year to $1.3 billion. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 29% year-over-year, with fixed FX growth reflecting strength in the Brazilian real.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, were $9.8 billion, up 28% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.2 billion, up 34% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation; and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube; as well as hardware-related costs, reflecting the continued strong performance of our new Made by Google product line.
Operating expenses were $8.4 billion in the quarter, up 15% year-over-year.",".

What was the main driver of growth in cost of revenues?
The main driver of growth in cost of revenues was primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation; and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube; as well as hardware-related costs, reflecting the continued strong performance of our new Made by Google product line."
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Year-on-year comparisons in part reflect the change in the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle with a half-year grant in Q1, which enables us to move to a single annual compensation cycle. As discussed last quarter, this affects the timing of stock-based compensation, but does not affect the overall size of the SBC expense for the year. The year-on-year increase is therefore more sizable in Q1 and Q2 compared to previous years, with less of a year-on-year impact in both Q3 and Q4.
More specifically, stock-based compensation totaled $2 billion, up 34% year-over-year. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 73,992, up 1,939 people from last quarter. The growth in consolidated headcount was somewhat muted by an internal reallocation of people from Fiber to Google.",".

Question: What caused the year-over-year increase in stock-based compensation in Q1 and Q2?
Answer: The increase in stock-based compensation was due to the change in the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle with a half-year grant in Q1, which enabled us to move to a single annual compensation cycle."
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers.
In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount growth was in cloud, consistent with the priority we place on this business. Operating income was $6.6 billion, up 23% versus last year. The operating margin was 27%. Other income and expense was $251 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.
Our effective tax rate was 20% for the first quarter, net income was $5.4 billion and earnings per diluted share were $7.73. Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow.
Cash CapEx for the quarter was $2.5 billion. Operating cash flow was $9.5 billion with free cash flow of $7 billion.",".

What was the increase in operating income compared to last year?
The operating income increased by 23%."
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $92.4 billion, of which approximately $55.7 billion or 60% is held overseas. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment.
Revenues were $24.5 billion, up 22% year-over-year, which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $17.4 billion in the quarter, up 21% year-over-year. The biggest contributor to growth again this quarter was mobile search, reflecting the secular shift to mobile due to the greater utility of smartphones for users and advertisers, but obviously, also benefiting from our focus on continuously enhancing features and functionality.
YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising. Network revenues were $4 billion, up 9% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing strong growth of Programmatic and AdMob.",".

Question: What was the biggest contributor to growth again this quarter?
Answer: Mobile search, reflecting the secular shift to mobile due to the greater utility of smartphones for users and advertisers."
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Results benefited from a slower rate of decline in the traditional network business than in prior periods, although it continues to be negatively affected by both the ongoing shift by advertisers to programmatic and our ongoing policy efforts.
Other revenues for Google were $3.1 billion, up 49%. Last quarter, we talked about our bigger investment areas, and you can see the strong momentum here, reflecting contributions from each of Play, hardware and cloud.
Specifically, Play benefited from both broad-based app strength, but also from all the work we have done in areas such as direct carrier billing, which helps more people globally access and buy their favorite apps and games on Google Play. Hardware continues to have strong growth and remains an important area for us with our family of products extending geographically.",".

Question: What is the main reason for the slower rate of decline in the traditional network business?
Answer: The slower rate of decline in the traditional network business is likely due to a shift by advertisers to programmatic buying and our ongoing policy efforts."
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Google Cloud continues to drive sizable growth, with Google Cloud platform remaining one of the fastest-growing businesses across Alphabet.
Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.6 billion or 22% of total advertising revenues, and up 22% year-over-year.",".

Question: What was the total traffic acquisition costs (TAC) for Alphabet's advertising businesses in Q1 2017?
Answer: The total traffic acquisition costs for Alphabet's advertising businesses was $4.6 billion in Q1 2017."
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: The increase in both sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues, as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues, reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was up year-over-year as a result of an increase in the sites TAC rate driven by the shift to mobile, which was again partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites, which carries lower TAC.
Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.9 billion for the quarter, up 40% year-over-year. Operating income, including the impact of SBC, was $7.6 billion, up 22% versus last year.",".

Question: What is the main reason for Alphabet's increase in TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues?
Answer: The increase in both sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues, as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues, reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC."
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: And the operating margin was 31%.
Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction.
Turning to Other Bets. For the first quarter, Other Bets revenues were $244 million, primarily generated by Nest, Verily and Fiber. Operating loss, including the impact of SBC, was $855 million for the first quarter. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $170 million, primarily reflecting a reduced investment in fiber due to the pause in expansion we announced in 3Q '16.
Let me conclude. First, we benefited from our team's innovations that continually enhance our advertising business as evidenced by the ongoing growth of sites revenues. On a dollar basis, the increase in sites revenues reflects the healthy growth in mobile search.",".

What was the operating margin for Alphabet's advertising business in the first quarter?
The operating margin for Alphabet's advertising business was 31%."
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: As we discussed in prior calls, even though mobile revenue growth requires an increasing investment in the mobile ecosystem in the form of higher TAC, our strength in mobile search is adding meaningfully to profit dollars.
Second, the strong performance in our advertising business allows us to take bigger bets within Google to fuel the growth of additional revenue streams, including those from cloud, hardware and YouTube subscription offerings.
Cloud is one of our most important strategic priorities, given the scale of opportunity in a rapidly evolving sector and the fact that the requirements for success align with many of our strengths. We will continue to invest here for the long-term opportunity.
Similarly, hardware remains an exciting growth opportunity for us, and you've seen the early indicators again this quarter.
Finally, in Other Bets.",".

What is the long-term opportunity for Cloud?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We're determining the size and pace of investment appropriate to each bet given their stage of development and achievements against milestones. We expect to increase near-term investment in certain areas while continuing to calibrate the pace of investment in others as they move along a path to commercialization. For example, as I hope you saw earlier this week, Waymo announced it has commenced the trial of its self-driving cars in the Phoenix area. Waymo also announced it is expanding its fleet of minivans to support this trial. These actions reflect the tremendous accomplishment of our team over many years, leading with safety and now beginning to bring the experience to consumers.
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.                                         
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO of Google    [4]

Now turning first to machine learning and access to information. I'm really happy with how we are transitioning to on AI-first company. The Google Assistant is one of our first steps towards that future. This quarter, we brought the assistant to your wrist with Android Wear 2.0, announced that it will soon come to Android TV and began rolling it out to hundreds of millions of people with Android phones running Nougat and Marshmallow.

To illustrate, in the past 3 years, in Europe, the Middle East and Africa alone, we paid out more than $15 billion to our publisher, creator and app developer partners. That's across AdSense, YouTube and Google Play. And it doesn't even include device sales by many hardware partners who build on Android. There's tremendous momentum in the Android ecosystem, as evidenced by the great reception of the beautiful Samsung Galaxy S8. We'll have much more to say at I/O next month.
In March, we introduced the first developer preview of Android O, featuring improvements for battery life, notifications and picture-in-picture display. The Android platform is also seeing great growth in emerging markets.",".

Question: What is the main reason for Alphabet's continued growth?
Answer: The main reason for Alphabet's continued growth is the shift to mobile."
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Two areas where we are seeing particular strength are retailers and app developers.
Mobile has transformed the shopping experience. In the past year, local shopping queries have increased by 45% and the number of retailers that provide us with their local inventory feeds has doubled. Our investments in innovative ad formats, improved targeting and better measurement are really helping retailers, who see us an ally in their corner. Brands like Williams Sonoma have seen a 70% increase in mobile sales year-over-year, with Google's mobile shopping ads playing a big part.
Secondly, developers use us to help their app stand out from the crowd. Thanks to our app-installed advertising products, developers have already driven more than 5 billion app downloads.",".

It incorporates machine learning to improve campaigns and drive great results for advertisers. We recently announced new innovations at the Game Developers Conference, including an interactive playable app format in Universal App Campaigns that lets users play a lightweight version of your game right in the ad. It's really effective in driving installs from engaged users.
Now on to our growing media advertising business. Brands love the reach and engagement that they get across YouTube, along with the effectiveness of formats like TrueView skippable ads and our new Bumper ads, which are snackable 6-second videos that drive incremental reach and frequency.",".

What is the interactive playable app format in Universal App Campaigns?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We recently did research on more than 120 Bumper ad campaigns, and the data showed that they drove a significant lift in brand awareness and ad recall.
Under Armour used both Bumper ads and TrueView together to promote a new product launch recently, resulting in double the lift in product interest among people who saw both ads compared to those who only saw the TrueView ad. We work incredibly hard to get the   to create the best environment for brands on YouTube. The cornerstone of our offering is Google Preferred, which allow brands to advertise against the top 5% of our content.
We also announced new safeguards for advertisers through a combination of updated ad policies and enforcement, new default settings around where ads can appear, improved controls for advertisers and third-party brand safety reporting.",".

What is the name of the company that used TrueView ads to promote a new product launch recently?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Brands and agencies understand how hard we work to create the safest possible environment. We do this while also being very careful to ensure YouTube's innovative creators can earn money to support their unique and popular content.
We've been actively engaged in conversations with clients about the new tools and controls we are providing, and we are having very productive discussions ahead of Brandcast next week.
Finally, programmatic advertising. As market has continued to shift to its programmatic ad buying, our DoubleClick platform makes it easy for them to effectively reach the right audiences. We've been focusing on making more inventory available to more advertisers, especially premium inventory.
For instance, we recently expanded our Programmatic Guaranteed reservation product to advertisers globally. And we made traditional TV inventory available to buy in DoubleClick Bid Manager.",".

What is Alphabet doing to make more inventory available to advertisers?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: So that's a run-through of some highlights for the quarter. Thanks to every Googler for making Google such an exciting and inspiring place to work every day.
Over the last few days, we have had Take Your Child to Work Day at Google, which is one of my favorite events of the year. We have had thousands of excited screaming kids running around the Googleplex, which is how I feel some days, too. What motivates us at Google is building the technologies that will be central to all of their computing experiences, to give them opportunities to learn, to be heard and to succeed.
And with that, I will hand it back over to Ruth.

Can you just talk more about the go-to-market strategy for GCP and how you plan on building up the reseller channel there going forward? And then, secondly, Sundar, on Waymo. I was curious on some of your thoughts, I know it's early, but on the timing for Waymo to become commercially viable. And then what are the key guideposts and requirements along the way?

Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: So we are thrilled with the progress we have made there since Diane arrived, building out world-class sales, marketing and engineering teams. The heavy lifting, I would say, is around how we meet the enterprises in the market. We have reorganized, so we have one face to the customer. So it's not just sales reps. We've been thoughtful about how we have built out the entire go-to-market organization. So we created 2 new areas that customers can now take advantage of. One is the office of the CTO, which helps customers solve difficult technical problems. And the second is our Advanced Solutions Lab, where customers can get help for machine learning experts. And on top of that, now, we have a phenomenal support team that helps keep customers' applications up and running.",".

Question: What is the office of the CTO?

Answer: The office of the CTO helps customers solve difficult technical problems."
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: So I think what we have done, our approach is One Google. When a customer signs up for Google Cloud, they get more than GCP and G Suite, they have access to the ads and analytics teams, YouTube teams and resources within our organization. So I think it's coming along quite well.

                                                   And then on your question on Waymo, we view Waymo as a great example of a graduate from X that's addressing a sizable problem and builds off of tremendous technology here. We started with safety. We remain a leader in safety, and we continue to view that as the foundation for success. And at this point, we're exploring many options, enabling ride-sharing, personal-use vehicles, logistics and deliveries. And we also see opportunities to work with cities to address public transportation.",".

Q: What are the options Waymo is exploring to enable ride-sharing, personal-use vehicles, logistics and deliveries?
A: The options Waymo is exploring include ride-sharing, personal-use vehicles, logistics and deliveries."
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: So the announcements that we made this week are a continuation of the progress the team has made. We do have a strong relationship with Fiat Chrysler, increased our car order given the opportunity. They have been our primary partner to date. But to note, we're in active discussions with others around the globe. And then I think, importantly, the trial in the Phoenix area is something that's been in the works for some time, and we do look forward to that trial. So it's still in the early days and we're excited about the upside from Waymo.

What is Waymo's plan for expanding its cloud services?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: I was just wondering, Sundar, if you could share with us, what's the feedback then since Next from your cloud customers? And could you share with us how, qualitatively, some things we can gauge just kind of whether this is starting to see   whether this business is starting to see an inflection on growth or not? Is there anything you could give us qualitatively about how the pipeline is building in this area? And I guess, just what I'm interested in is also the types of conversations you're having with customers now versus maybe 6 years ago   or I'm sorry, 6 months ago. Sorry about that.

What is the feedback from Next cloud customers?

Some things we can gauge qualitatively is that this business is starting to see an inflection on growth."
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: I mean, Next was   having them in Google I/O many, many times, I was surprised to see the scale and growth of Next from even last year to this year. We had 5 many times as (sic) [5x as many] people. I think everyone really appreciated seeing large customers, very sophisticated customers, like HSBC, eBay, Colgate-Palmolive, et cetera, discussing use of Google Cloud, GCP. Along with Diane, I did follow-up lunches with a set of people. And so the feedback has been very positive. People sense our commitment to the area. They understand the pace at which we are investing. They see that we have committed to machine learning and AI at a deep level. They appreciate how we are open sourcing things. Fei-Fei's talk was extraordinarily well received.","

What was the scale of Next's customer base in 2017? 5x as many"
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: They are noticing the acquisitions we are making of Kaggle and AppBridge, a couple of acquisitions which happened around that time. So all that, all those details, I think, clearly made an impact. I just spoke about the go-to-market progress. And I think that's beginning to get traction as well. In general, I think there is a very strong recognition that we have pivoted to being a deep enterprise company and conversations are very strategic. We are engaging at the highest levels within companies. And so overall, I can see qualitatively the momentum there. When we are in the middle of deals, we find we are very competitive and there are areas where our customers perceive us as best-in-class already. So it's been exciting to see.

                                                   Sundar, you mentioned Google Assistant in your remarks. I wanted to know, what have you seen in terms of consumer adoption of Google Assistant, whether at the Pixel level or the Google Home level? What does it give you in terms of sense in how people want to interact with the Assistant, what it might do in terms of putting artificial intelligence capabilities down to the consumer level and improve consumer experiences over the next couple of years?                                         
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO of Google    [10]
                                                   Good question, Eric. I mean, Pixel is a good example because I think it's the place where we do the leading work here.",".



What are your thoughts on the consumer adoption of Google Assistant?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: And how we presented Google Assistant in the Pixel, well received, both qualitatively in terms of consumer feedback we get, quantitatively in terms of how we see people using voice, how we see people interacting with overall Google Assistant and search better. So we find that when we drive the Assistant experience well, it works overall in helping people engage with Google at a broader level. It's always surprising to us, all they said. Even with search, every single day, we see so many new types of queries. When you bring the Assistant in the mix, you start getting even more different types of queries. And queries are more casual, more conversational. And so over time, I think it starts breaking down the barriers to computing people have, and that's what makes it very, very exciting.",".

What ""over time"" does Alphabet Inc. expect the Assistant to break down barriers to computing?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Now artificial intelligence will help us push all that further. Just to give an example, we will make text to speech much, much better over time. Yesterday, we announced our neural machine translation is launching in 9 new languages. So all that starts accruing to the Assistant and I think will overall improve the consumer experience pretty dramatically. We'll talk about all this a lot more at Google I/O.

Mark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [12]
                                                   Two questions, please, one on YouTube and one on Google Maps. Sundar or Ruth, there was some press about the   some of the pushback or some of the controversy around content and advertising and monetization of that."," on how Alphabet plans to address that. And secondly, on YouTube, there was a report that suggests that the average age of YouTube subscribers is dropping. What's your comment on that?

Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google: So, on the first question, we're really focused on making sure that the ads that are served are high-quality and relevant. We're also making sure that we're working with our partners to make sure that they're complying with our policies. And on the second question, I think it's really important to point out that we've been investing really heavily in content over the last few years. We've been hiring more people, we've been investing in technology, and I think that's really paying off. So I don't think that there's any indication that subscribers are dropping off."
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Are those technical problems that can be solved over time? Or is it just the magnitude of the volume of content and trying to keep bad content off the site, however that's defined, and keep it from being monetized? Is that just   is that an ongoing technology challenge? Or did you only already find a solution? And do you see any material impact to advertisers' budget interest with YouTube? And then if you could also comment briefly on Google Maps. This is one of those massive properties that you've owned that's highly used by almost everybody. And I think the monetization to date has been really de minimis. Is there anything that's changed for you in terms of your thought about the ability to monetize Google Maps over time?

                                                   On advertising and monetization in YouTube, we talked a bit about it. We have taken it pretty seriously, and we are taking significant steps. And obviously, as part of doing that, we brought new technical solutions into place. Machine learning is a great example of it. It helps us enforce   as we improve our policies, it helps us enforce it better. And we are in early days. So as machine learning gets better, I think we'll be able to do all of this even better and create that virtuous cycle. Overall, I'm pretty confident at the rate at which we have made progress. And we are going to continue investing a lot here. It is super important to us that this ecosystem works well. It matters for advertisers. It matters for content creators.",".

What is Google's machine learning solution?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: And so we take that responsibility very seriously. I would say advertisers have clearly noticed all the improvements we have made. Our conversations with them are very, very positive. And so I'm pretty optimistic about how we'll continue to make progress here. On Google Maps, your question is   it's a good question. I get surprised that for a property, which we had launched many, many years ago, even now that it's showing strong growth, especially in emerging markets. Maps is an integral part of your mobile phone. And as we get more   as users get more interested in the real world around them, with AR and so on, I think Maps will continue to play a bigger role. We take a long-term view. It's already impacting monetization very significantly for us with local search.","

Q: What are the main drivers of Maps' growth?
A: The main drivers of Maps' growth are its integration with mobile devices and its role in local search."
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: So today, when you use Google, a lot of the information we are able to do is because of Google Maps. But I'm sure you've noticed changes within Google Maps over the past few months. If you open Google Maps, you're traveling or you're out on a Friday evening, we start surfacing a lot more interesting information about what you can do, places to eat and so on. So those are beginning to get good feedback from users. And I think that gives us opportunity to add value there over time as well.

You've mentioned increasing take-up of local inventory ads. We understand that. But more generally, your go-to-market strategy on how you reach the millions of SMBs out there in terms of educating them on the growing opportunities on a local basis.

                                                   It's a great question, and I think there's a lot of opportunity for us. Today, we have many touch points. Obviously, people, we reach out to SMBs. They want to get listed in Search and in Maps. AdWords Express has been a big part of how they want to advertise on our platforms. We obviously provide things like Google Apps to SMBs.",".

What kind of touch points do you have with SMBs?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: So we have a lot of touch points. And internally, we are beginning to do a much better job of reaching out and having a more thoughtful go-to-market approach. I think there's a lot more work there. But the rate at which we are seeing advertisers, small and medium businesses, on our platform has been growing very, very strongly as well. So indications are that it's already currently working at scale. We have millions and millions of SMBs on our platform, and the number continues to grow very well.

Any high-level commentary on consumer search, query trends in retail, either an area of strength or otherwise? And then you talked about the real-time local inventory integration.

We've also seen some official policy changes, things like that. I'd be interested, Sundar, to hear a little bit more about some of the softer outreach that you may be doing, thinking of Philipp Schindler's team, maybe the agency relations team and how your people are reaching out and connecting with their clients, especially as you go into Brandcast.

One of the things I've noticed is depth of relationships we have with our advertisers was very evident to me as we went through this over the past few weeks. I would estimate, I think, Philipp Schindler's team has probably made literally thousands and thousands of calls, in-persons conversations. And I think that deep relationship is what allowed us to respond thoughtfully.",".

And the excitement out of Brandcast, both internally and from our partners, all has the right indications for us. On YouTube on Spaces, I visited the YouTube Space. I took my family to the YouTube Space in New York and we had a lot of fun. Our creators love these spaces. They are something we are thoughtfully building out.

                                                   Yes, exactly. And the CapEx, when I talked about production equipment, we were talking about machines, and that was the primary driver here. We're investing more in machines, given both our growing requirements and the higher cost of the new generation of machines and accelerators. So that will be more expensive in the short term, and we are continuing to build our inventory, but it does increase performance and, we believe, reduce total cost of ownership in the longer term.

I think in the case of Russia, I think there were some specific issues, and I'm glad we were able to work together with the regulatory agencies there, with our partners there to come to a good solution.

And over the last 4 years, you had an acceleration with PLAs, a really acceleration with the third ad link. I'm just wondering, maybe you could talk about what excites you. Or do you think there's still a lot to go on search monetization or coverage? And then from Ruth, obviously, so many areas you can invest in. You could cut price on cloud. You could really ramp up engineers in the core or cloud. Just a lot you can do.

So that   and with the Assistant now, too, just exposes a whole new surface area. And so I think there's a lot of innovation ahead. In terms of monetization, I think about it. It still looks like there is a lot of   for example, if you just look at retail, 90% of retail is still offline.

When we look at the ongoing momentum that you're seeing here in sites revenue, it really does go to innovation. No one change tends to drive results. It's really the combined benefit of all that we're doing across the franchise, continuing to invest in the business and the benefits that we see there.

And the other factors include the mix of paid versus organic as well as changes in partner mix or agreement terms. And when we look year-over-year, the primary driver of the increase is, very much to your question, the strength in mobile search, and we do expect sites TAC to increase as a percentage of revenues.

The thing which gives me excitement is all these changes start happening with a set of early adopters and most mainstream. And so we are engaging at that level with the early adopters, and that's where Daydream is working well. We are learning how to write great content on top of VR.

What are Alphabet's long-term plans for its artificial intelligence and machine learning initiatives?"

                                                   I guess this is a follow-up to the question on voice interfaces and personal assistants, something that Larry also called out in his Founders letter. It appears there are more tests around monetization, including transactions and integration with Shopping Express. I wonder if there's a view internally now as to how best to make that transition in a voice-first world towards monetization towards voice and less text and video-centric.                                         
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO of Google    [43]
                                                   We are very focused actually on the consumer experience now. And it's a good question. And we have always had these questions, be it the early days of search or when YouTube was first built out.",". 1. What are some of the tests around monetization that you are currently undertaking? 
2. How do you think about monetizing voice-first experiences?"
Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: How do [I see these] experiences created, like, will YouTube ever make money? And so I think if you go and create these experiences in a way that works at scale for users, the monetization will follow. And obviously   and the models will be different than we have today. But I think we are squarely focused right now on delivering a world-class experience through voice and through Assistant.

Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc - CFO    [3]
                                                   Thank you. Our revenue of $26.1 billion in the fourth quarter underscores the continued excellent performance of our businesses globally. For the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenue grew 24% in constant currency versus 4Q 2015, notwithstanding a challenging year-on-year comparison. Advertising revenue growth was driven by mobile search, with ongoing strength in YouTube and programmatic. We also had substantial growth in other revenues from hardware, play and cloud. 
Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet. Given the obvious seasonality in Q4, I'll focus on year-over-year changes in our results.",".

Q: What was the main driver of advertising revenue growth in the fourth quarter?
A: Mobile search was the main driver of advertising revenue growth in the fourth quarter."
Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: You can find quarterly comparisons in the earnings release. 
Second, I'll review the results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with a summary of the full year results and our outlook. Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take questions. 
Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenue was $26.1 billion, up 22% year-over-year. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $202 million, or $[15] million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenue grew 24% year-over-year. 
Alphabet revenues by geography highlight the strength of our business around the globe. US revenue was up 24% year-over-year to $12.7 billion.",".

Question: What was the negative currency impact on Alphabet's revenues year-over-year?
Answer: The negative currency impact on Alphabet's revenues year-over-year was $202 million, or $[15] million after the benefit of our hedging program."
Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: UK revenue was up 7% year-over-year to $2.1 [billion], reflecting the continued weakness of the British pound relative to last year. In fixed FX terms, the UK grew 21% year-over-year. Rest of world revenue was up 24% versus last year to $11.3 billion, in fixed FX terms revenues were up 26% year-over-year. 
GAAP other cost of revenues, was $5.8 billion, up 41% year-over-year. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $5.5 billion, up 41% year-over-year primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically costs associated with operating our data centers including depreciation, and content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube, as well as hardware. 
The impact of our Q4 hardware launches is reflected in both revenues and cost of revenues.",".

What was the main driver of growth in non-GAAP other cost of revenues?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: However, it's important to note the cost of revenues was also affected by approximately $320 million of one-time charges related to equipment, and other adjustments which were unrelated to hardware. GAAP operating expenses were $8.8 billion in the quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $7.3 billion, up 10% year-over-year. 
Year-on-year comparisons in part reflect the impact of the expenses from project milestones and Other Bets in 4Q 2015 that we discussed last year. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $6.6 billion, up 23% versus last year. The operating margin was 25%. Non-GAAP operating income was $8.5 billion, up 24% versus last year. The operating margin was 33%. 
Stock-based compensation totalled $1.8 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Head count at the end of the quarter was just over 72,000, up 2,100 people from last quarter.",".

Question: What were the one-time charges related to equipment?
Answer: The one-time charges related to equipment were $320 million."
Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as cloud, including the addition of employees from our Apigee acquisition. Other income and expense was $218 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. 
Our effective tax rate was 22% for the fourth quarter, reflecting the geographic mix of earnings and certain discrete items affecting our US rate. Our effective tax rate for the full year 2016 was 19%. Net income was $5.3 billion on a GAAP basis, and $6.6 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $7.56 on a GAAP basis, and $9.36 on a non-GAAP basis. 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow, cash CapEx for the quarter was $3.1 billion.",".

What was the GAAP net income for the fourth quarter?
The GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $5.3 billion."
Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Operating cash flow was $9.4 billion, with free cash flow of $6.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $86.3 billion, of which approximately $52 billion or 61% is held overseas. 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results starting with the Google segment. Revenue was $25.8 billion, up 22% year-over-year which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenue was $18 billion in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year. Year-on-year growth reflects strength in mobile search. 
YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView, including buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager. Network revenue was $4.4 billion, up 7% year-on-year reflecting the ongoing strong growth of programmatic and AdMob offset by the traditional network businesses.","

What was the main driver of Google's revenue growth in the quarter?
The main driver of Google's revenue growth in the quarter was the impact of FX."
Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Other revenue for Google was $3.4 billion, up 62% year-over-year with strong performance from each of hardware, Play and Cloud. 
Finally, we continued to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. Let me remind you that these metrics are affected by currency movements. 
Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.8 billion or 22% of total advertising revenue, and up 20% year-over-year. The increase in both sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenue, as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenue reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic carry higher TAC.",".

Question: What was the main driver of Google's 62% year-over-year growth in other revenue? 
Answer: The main driver of Google's 62% year-over-year growth in other revenue was strong performance from each of hardware, Play and Cloud."
Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up as a result of an increase in the sites TAC rate driven by the shift to mobile, which was partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites which carries lower TAC. 
Operating income excluding SBC was $9.5 billion, up 19% versus last year for an operating margin of 37%. Google stock-based compensation totaled $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 29% year-over-year. Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $7.9 billion, up 17% versus last year, and the operating margin was 31%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $2.9 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction.",".

Question: What was the total advertising revenue for Alphabet Inc.?
Answer: Alphabet Inc. reported total advertising revenue of $24.5 billion in Q4 2016."
Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: 
Turning Other Bets, I'll cover results for the full year 2016, because it's most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer time horizon as discussed previously. Results for the quarter are in our earnings release. For the full year 2016 Other Bets revenue was $809 million, up 82% versus 2015 primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. Operating loss excluding SBC was $2.9 billion for the full year 2016, a slight decline from 2015. Including the impact of SBC, the operating loss was $3.6 billion for the full year, an increase of 4% over 2015. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $1.4 billion for the full year 2016, up 63% over 2015. 
Before I move to my conclusion, I'll quickly cover some specific changes to our past practices. First, we are making changes to our non-GAAP reporting.",".

What is Alphabet Inc's non-GAAP reporting?

The company is making changes to its non-GAAP reporting, which includes excluding the impact of SBC."
Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: SBC has always been an important part of how we reward our employees in a way that aligns their interest with those of all shareholders. Although it is not a cash expense, we consider it to be a real cost of running our business because SBC is critical to our ability to attract and retain the best talent in the world. 
Starting with our first quarter results for 2017, we will no longer regularly exclude stock-based compensation expense from non-GAAP results. Non-cash stock-based compensation will continue to be reported on our cash flow statement, but we will no longer be providing a reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures that reflects SBC and related tax benefits. Second, we are shifting the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle for employees to the first quarter of every year.",".

Question: What will be the impact of this change on SBC's financial results?
Answer: The impact of this change on SBC's financial results is that stock-based compensation expense will no longer be excluded from non-GAAP results, and the timing of the annual equity refresh cycle for employees will be shifted to the first quarter of every year."
Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: The next full year equity refresh will occur in the first quarter of 2018. 
Because the last full employee equity refresh occurred in the third quarter of 2016, we are providing employees with a one-time half grant in the first quarter of 2017. Overall, total SBC for 2017 will be roughly the same as it would have been, had we maintained a Q3 refresh cycle. However, given the shift in refresh timing, there will not be the historical seasonal increase in SBC in Q3 and Q4. We do not plan any changes to our senior executive equity refresh, which occurs every two years with the next one planned for 2018. 
Third, to hedge our non-US dollar earnings, we are moving from using options only to using primarily forwards. We believe they will be a more effective way to hedge earnings.",".

What is the reason for the shift in refresh timing?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We intend to continue to use options selectively. 
We continue to believe that constant currency revenue growth provides the best insight into underlying trends by isolating the impact of currency movements on revenue. We will continue to provide constant currency results for consolidated revenues, as well as for revenues by geography. This will give you a view into the effects of currency movements on our revenue. 
Turning now to our full year 2016 performance and outlook. 2016 was simply a great year for us. Our extraordinarily talented employees worked very hard and successfully for our users around the globe. That commitment is reflected in the Company's exceptional financial results. 
For the full year 2016 consolidated revenue grew 20%, and excluding the impact of currency movements grew 24%. GAAP operating income was up 23%.",".

What is the impact of currency movements on consolidated revenue?
The impact of currency movements on consolidated revenue is that it affects the value of the revenue that is generated in different currencies."
Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: This performance is a testament to the ongoing innovation that is driving our success in mobile search, YouTube, and programmatic advertising, each of which we believe has only begun to scratch the surface. We remain excited about the sizeable opportunities that have not yet been tapped. 
Alongside these businesses, we are focused on growing additional revenue streams within Google over the medium- and long-term. In 2016, our other revenue line grew 41% on a full year basis reflecting the growth in our Play, hardware and cloud businesses. We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube.",".

Question: What are the other revenue streams within Google that have seen growth in 2016?
Answer: The other revenue streams within Google that have seen growth in 2016 include Play, hardware and cloud businesses."
Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We're investing in our cloud and hardware businesses, as well as our newer non-ad revenue sources for YouTube, in order to accelerate their progress as major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years. 
We're also investing significantly in the machine learning capabilities and next generation computing infrastructure that will propel Google's growth over the longer term. For our Other Bets, we continue to calibrate the magnitude and pace of investment appropriate to their individual execution paths. A couple of our recent announcements demonstrate our approach here. 
First, in December, Waymo graduated into a standalone business within Other Bets. We did this because Waymo achieved agreed thresholds on the path to commercialization in its technical and business model.",".

What was the ""path to commercialization"" that Waymo achieved?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Waymo continues to excel at safety, has begun putting its new Chrysler Pacifica minivans on the road, and is continuing to drive down hardware costs. 
Nest delivered an outstanding performance this holiday season with sales of key products more than doubling over the two weeks including Black Friday and Cyber Monday. And just this morning, Verily announced that Temasek has agreed to invest $800 million for a minority stake in the Company. Temasek's extensive experience with life sciences and healthcare companies, and deep understanding of Asian markets make it a valuable long-term partner for Verily. 
The internal transparency we've provided to our business leaders across the Other Bets and Google is helping us to allocate resources more thoughtfully across the opportunities that we see.",".

What is Temasek's investment in Verily?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We remain committed to managing for long-term revenue and EPS growth, for dollars rather than margin targets, while exercising careful stewardship over the amounts and pace of investment. I will now turn the call over to Sundar.                                          
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc - CEO, Google Inc.    [4]
                                                   Thanks, Ruth. 2016 was a great year for Google, and 2017 is shaping up to be even more exciting. This quarter was about the business firing on all cylinders, and terrific progress across Google's newer areas of investments. Today, I'm going to talk about three things. First, the key trend powering Google today, machine learning, and how it's improving our products and creating lots of opportunities. 
In particular, how it's underpinning our core mission of providing access to information for everyone, especially via the Google Assistant which is off to a great start.",".

1. What is machine learning and how is it powering Google today? 
2. What are some of the benefits of machine learning for Google? 
3. How is machine learning helping to improve Google's products?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Second, I want to talk about three of our biggest bets, YouTube, cloud, and hardware where we are making great progress. And third, I'll discuss the great trends we're seeing across the platforms, our vibrant computing platforms, Android, Chrome and Daydream, strong momentum in Google Play, as well are thriving advertising platform. First, machine learning, and access to information. 
As I've shared, before computing is moving from a mobile first to AI first, with more universal ambient and intelligent computing that you can interact with naturally, all made smarter by the progress we are making with machine learning. 2016 was the year that this became central to who we are as a Company, and the products that we build. We had more than 350 launches powered by machine learning across areas like search, maps, messaging and Google Play.",".

What is the main focus for Alphabet Inc in 2016?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: You've heard lots of these examples, easier email replies and inbox, better YouTube recommendations, the incredible cameras on our Pixel phones, and smarter bidding for advertisers in [adverts]. 
A central piece of our machine learning efforts is the Google Assistant which allows users to have a natural conversation with Google, to help them get things done across their experience. It's off to a great start. You can easily ask it to navigate to home, tell you about your schedule for the day, or even play trivia. We reached a milestone last month with the announcement of the Assistant developer platform called Actions on Google.

                                                   So on the first question, in terms of YouTube as Sundar elaborated on my opening comments, we're really pleased with the ongoing strength we have there. As we've  talked about on prior calls it's largely driven by video, primarily trivia with a strong contribution from DoubleClick Bid Manager. And we are continuing to invest significantly in the business, given the importance of supporting the ecosystem of content creators, through partner payments, marketing, YouTube originals, YouTube spaces. We're broadening the platform, we're investing in the requisite infrastructure given machines and bandwidth required. And Sundar elaborated on some of the upside, we see there on the non-ad side.",".

Question: What is the company's outlook for YouTube?
Answer: The company sees continued strength on YouTube, with a majority of its growth coming from trivia and video content."
Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: 
And really the point, I was trying to stress consistent with Sundar's comments is, we got the non-ads momentum here on the YouTube side, and we're also seeing tremendous momentum with cloud which we're excited about, and the hardware and investing behind those. So those continue to build out the revenue streams, as we're looking in the near- to medium- to long-term.

                                                   And, Doug, I mean, just like Mark's question on voice search, I would encourage you to think about it as from a user's standpoint, they are looking for information, looking to get things done. The voice queries are one part of the total journey they are on.",.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: So when we think about something like the Google Assistant, we think about this as an ongoing conversation with our users across different contexts. 
So they may ask a question on voice, later when they pick up their phone, they want connectivity, so we think of this as an end-to-end thing. What this means is that users engage more with us, more with computing, and look for more information. And I think, the trends we see are positive. So we think about it from a long-term perspective, and so I see more opportunity than challenge, when I think about voice search.

On your question around, how we think about the experience across screens, it's really important to understand users consume on YouTube across screens, and so they experience consistent experience. And similarly from an advertising standpoint, we want that to be thoughtful for users, more relevant across screens as well. And so, that's the context in which we do this. 
We give users control over that experience, but I do think as part of these changes, advertisers can get more detailed insights from their YouTube campaigns across devices. So they can better understand the impact of their marketing campaigns. So I think it's early days, but I think it's the right direction, and I think we'll see good traction from it.

Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: As you noted that, there can be some seasonality, and Q1 is typically lower than the fourth quarter. 
I think the main point is that the programmatic business continues to be a strong contributor, with significant growth reflecting the ongoing advertiser adoption, just given the overall efficiency of programmatic and improved targeting and benefit of inventory growth. And so, the story, it's pretty much unchanged. We continue to see the growth in programmatic, offset by the declines in the more traditional businesses. And when you're looking at the quarter-over-quarter, you're continuing to see things like the impact of policy changes, and timing of product launches. But I just think that there were a number of things that went well this quarter. Q3 was a bit lighter, so that then [flattered] the quarter-over-quarter comparison, but I wouldn't extrapolate from this.",".

Secondarily, it seems like the recurring theme in your prepared remarks is how AI is making the consumer products better. Is there anything you can share, in terms of how it may be making monetization better? Thank you.

Question: How does Alphabet Inc view its own instant apps, as well as products from some other operators to let consumers try apps, either in a Messenger product, or in an HTML5 environment?

                                                   So on Google Play for me, what makes it work well is, just with the vision of computing we have been talking about how it works across context. You need an ecosystem   you need an apps and services ecosystem to work cohesively across all of this. And that's what I like about how we are approaching Google Play. And you saw us this quarter, see Google Play work beyond Android phones, they're coming to Chromebooks, they're working Daydream, they're working Android Wear. And so, it's an end-to-end thing which works well. 
And that's the most important thing, so that as a user you know whether you're engaging with a game or a TV show, that you can get it reliably get it across your computing experiences.",".

What makes Google Play work well is the ecosystem of apps and services it has."
Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: And we'll adapt, and I think we will drive innovations in play to go where, what's right for users and developers, and so, be it instant apps, or driving better HTML5 experiences. We invest in all that, and I think we'll move it all forward. 
On your second question, about how machine learning and AI is improving our monetization, it definitely, just like we had many, many launches last year, which involved machine learning being incorporated across Google including our monetization products. And our monetization teams at Google have always been at the cutting edge of, what I would call [out], as machine learning techniques from early days on. And so, they are doing it. It is early days, now but I think we already have really new insights. And so, we'll bake it in, over the course of the year.",".

Question: What are some of the new insights that Google's monetization teams have gleaned from incorporating machine learning into their products?
Answer: Some of the new insights that Google's monetization teams have gleaned from incorporating machine learning into their products include the ability to better predict user behavior and to generate more accurate ad targeting."

                                                   Hi, just maybe another question on YouTube. Can you expand on the decision this quarter to remove third-party cookie and Pixel activity? It looks like as though you're favoring something much more identity-based, and maybe you could just think through the   or explain a bit about the impetus there, and maybe the trade-offs for marketers, that would be great? Thank you very much.                                          
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc - CEO, Google Inc.    [47]
                                                   I spoke about it a bit earlier, but I think it's important that we evolve all of this from a user-centric standpoint. And users have an identity, they have preferences.",".

Operator    [48]

Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.

Michael Pachter, Wedbush Securities - Analyst    [49]

Hey, thanks for taking my question. So I guess just a follow-up on the YouTube thing. It sounds like you're favoring something that's more identity-based over something that's just based on cookies. Can you give me a little bit more detail on what that preference is and why you think that's the right thing to do?

Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc - CEO, Google Inc.    [50]

Sure. So we've been working on this for a while, and we've seen that a lot of people are using YouTube with multiple devices, and they want to use the same account across all of those devices. So we've been working on this for a while, and we think it's the right thing to do."
Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: And so, for example, think about it from a user standpoint, if they don't like one particular ad, or they don't want to see an ad from a particular advertiser, they want it work across that experience, across their cross-device experience. So we think about it that way. And so, we're working towards a long-term experience that's right for users, and which I think will make sense for advertisers reaching users too. So I think we are evolving it jointly and thoughtfully giving users control. And I think that's the right way to approach it over time.

What is Alphabet's plan to increase ad coverage and click rates?"
Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Maybe just your thoughts on potential to increase ad coverage now, that you have a fourth link. Is there still room to help ad clicks with coverage increases? And just as you think out to this year, how do you feel about the innovation pipeline in ads? Do you think there is a lot more you can still do in search? And then two, housekeeping for you, Ruth. Maybe you could just let us know what kind of equipment was written off, so we can think how recurring that might be? And any comment on the buyback activity in the quarter?

Q1. What is Alphabet Inc's strategy for monetization?
A. Our strategy is to generate more revenue from our advertising products and services."
Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q4 2016 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We don't start the year, thinking our plan is to increase ad coverage or something like that, right? We are   we have many experiments in the pipeline. We see how user behavior is evolving. And in conjunction with that, we evolve our ad experience. So for example, as people use mobiles, scroll more, et cetera, the user behavior changes, and we adapt to that in a very, very disciplined way. 
So last year, you saw us maybe increase coverage in a certain way. For example, in desktop we removed ads on the right-hand side, and so we take a very holistic approach to these things. For me, I do think we have a lot of head room ahead. I still look at where most of transactions happen, and how the secular transformation is under way.",".

What is the company's strategy for increasing ad coverage?

The company's strategy is to evolve their ad experience in response to user behavior changes."

                                                   And in terms of your second question, really not much more to add on the first part. In terms of the buyback, we weren't able to commence it on the fourth quarter due to trading restrictions, but we do look forward to getting back into the market.

Question: What was the main driver of advertising revenues growth in the second quarter? 
Answer: The main driver of advertising revenues growth in the second quarter was the strong performance in sites, which was led in particular by tremendous results in mobile search with a strong contribution from YouTube."
Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We also had substantial growth in other revenues from Cloud, Play and hardware.
Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. I will review our results on a GAAP basis, which include the impact of stock-based compensation.
The European Commission fine of USD 2.7 billion is reflected in our GAAP results with the fine displayed as a separate line item for clarity. In order to assist with comparing this quarter's results to prior periods, we are also providing operating income, net income and EPS results that exclude the impact of the fine. The fine is not reflected in our segment results.
Second, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook.",".

What was the main driver of Alphabet's year-over-year growth in other revenues?
The main driver of Alphabet's year-over-year growth in other revenues was the increase in Cloud, Play and hardware revenues."
Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Sundar will then discuss our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take questions.

What was the total cost of revenues, including TAC, for Alphabet Inc.?

Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Excluding the impact of the EC fine, operating expenses were $8.8 billion in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year. Year-on-year expense growth reflects the change in the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle from the third quarter to the first quarter of each year.
As discussed previously, this affects the quarterly pace of stock-based compensation in 2017 but not the overall size of the expense for the year. In order to transition to the new timing, we made a onetime half year grant in Q1 of this year, which is reflected in elevated year-on-year expense growth in Q2. As a result, stock-based compensation totaled $2 billion, up 33% year-over-year.
Headcount at the end of the quarter was 75,606, up 1,614 people from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers.",".

Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: The increase in both sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenue as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was up year-over-year as a result of an increase in the sites TAC rate driven by the shift to mobile, which was again partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites, which carries lower TAC.
Google stock-based compensation totaled $1.9 billion for the quarter, up 40% year-over-year. Operating income, including the impact of SBC, was $7.8 billion, up 12% versus last year, and the operating margin was 30%.",".

Questions and Answers
                                        
Operator    [1]
                                                   (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from John Blackledge   I'm sorry. Our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS.                                         
Eric James Sheridan,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst    [2]
                                                   Maybe a big picture question directed to Sundar."," that is not mentioned. 

What are your thoughts on the state of the internet and Alphabet's role in it?"
Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: As you think about the Google Assistant and what it can do medium to long term, maybe talk a little bit about how the Assistant, as a product, could narrow the gap between consumption and utility inside your products versus monetization over time with the specific focus   I'd love to hear about local in particular.                                         
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - Director & CEO of Google    [3]
                                                   It's a good question. When I think about, we have   we're very focused over the long term to making sure the Assistant can actually help people get things done in the real world. And so obviously, when you think about it from that standpoint, local becomes important. Over time, just like when the transition happened from desktop to mobile, people's bar for what they expect increased. They wanted more answers.",". Sundar Pichai, Alphabet Inc. - Director & CEO of Google

How do you think the Assistant can help narrow the gap between consumption and utility inside your products versus monetization over time?"
Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: They wanted more immediate gratification, right? And that's a continuum, and I think you'll see the trends. And so over time, we are laser focused on making sure we can deliver against those experiences. And I think local and their particular strength over time, both in terms of the expertise we have built in local as well as our investment in Maps is hopefully paying off.                                         
Operator    [4]
                                                   And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan.                                         
Douglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [5]
                                                   First one for Ruth. I was just hoping you could help us understand at least qualitatively how core margins for the advertising business are trending within the Google segment. And then, Sundar, just on the cloud business, I know you talked about 4 new regions being built out."," on each of those.

Doug Anmuth: So on the advertising business, I think we're seeing a bit of a slowdown in growth rates, but I think the key thing to note is that we're still seeing very strong margins. And so I think that's something that we're really happy with. And then on the cloud business, I think we're seeing continued growth in terms of both revenue and margin. And so I think that's something that we're really happy with as well."
Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Can you just talk about your strategy in building out that cloud infrastructure, how we should think about it in terms of building out extra capacity or whether it's more in line with near-term demand?                                         
Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - CFO and SVP    [6]
                                                   Thanks. So starting with your margin question. Look, as we've often said, we're focused on revenue and operating income dollar growth and not on operating margins. We have strong positions in healthy, growing areas and are adding really exciting additional growth areas. And that's what we mean when we discuss driving long-term revenue and earnings growth.",".

What are the areas that Alphabet Inc. is focusing on for long-term revenue and earnings growth?"
Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: To get a little more specific, the gross margin this quarter obviously reflects our product mix shift, and although the cost of sales is higher as a percentage of revenues, these costs are associated with high-growth product areas that enable us to create value for all of our stakeholders. And then on the OpEx side, the second quarter reflects a number of factors. First, I think, really, to your question on an over time point, you can see the impact of the timing shift in the equity refresh, which we discussed previously. Now as a reminder, that does abate in the back half of the year, but you can see it here in the second quarter. And then what you're also seeing in OpEx growth is the investments in areas that we've spelled out.",".

Question: What are some of the investments in areas that you've spelled out?

Answer: We're making investments in areas like data science, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing."
Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: So for example, in R&D, you can see the impact of the headcount increases in our priority areas, particularly cloud and machine learning, and marketing spend similarly reflects the strategic priority areas we've delineated, particularly hardware and YouTube subscription. But as I said in my opening comments, we're increasing investment in areas where we see the most potential. We're scaling it back in others. We're focused on organizational effectiveness to make the most of all of our resources, and all of that really underpins the goal to sustain both revenue and earnings growth over the longer term.                                         
Operator    [7]

                                                   I was just wondering, Sundar, you mentioned some of the strength you're seeing in GCP, and I was just wondering if you could share with us, when you do win, is there any commonality around the type of workloads that people are choosing you for? And can you share with us any updates on the go to market and kind of how you feel about where you've come over the last year? But even more importantly, what do you need to do to get it where you need it to be over the next 12 months?                                         
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - Director & CEO of Google    [9]

Question: What is the commonality around the type of workloads that people are choosing you for? 
Answer: Google Cloud Platform offers a variety of services that can be used to power different types of applications."
Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Also, I'll take Doug's question on the infrastructure, too, and do it together since they are related to cloud. Overall, when we think about our infrastructure, obviously, we are serving cloud as well as our internal products, which are seeing tremendous growth as well. In terms of serving cloud customers, we are world class in availability and being reliable, and those are things we want to stay best in class. So we're clearly planning for that and planning ahead for our infrastructure, and we have been consistently doing that. And Heather, in terms of your question about workloads and stuff, we are actually seeing quite a diverse set of use cases across sectors and industries and geographies. And so I would say the breadth of what we have seen has really surprised me.",".

Answer: We have seen a really diverse set of use cases across sectors and industries and geographies."
Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: In terms of go to market, I shared an update on it last quarter. Not sure there's much more interesting to add. We are continuing to do it well. We are scaling up, and all the teams and the structure Diane has put in place is beginning to work well. And we are continuing to hire and scale all of this up as quickly as we can.                                         
Operator    [10]
                                                   And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.                                         
Mark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - MD and Analyst    [11]
                                                   I had 2 questions, please. First, one on TAC. Ruth, the factors that cause   have been causing TAC to rise seemed relatively structural, the outsized growth of mobile and the rise of programmatic."," on what Alphabet is doing to mitigate that. And then secondly, on the other hand, there's been a lot of commentary about how the ad market is slowing down and that's impacting Alphabet's business. What's your take on that?

On the TAC front, we continue to see strong growth in programmatic and mobile advertising. We are seeing good performance from our DoubleClick Bid Manager product, which helps manage and optimize ad campaigns across all channels. We are also seeing good performance from our Google Ads products, which help advertisers reach more people with their ads. We are seeing good performance from our YouTube products, which helps advertisers reach more people with their videos. And we are seeing good performance from our AdSense products, which help publishers monetize their websites.

We are seeing some slowdown in the overall ad market, but we believe that this slowdown is temporary and that the ad market will eventually recover. We are continuing to invest in our products and our teams to ensure that we are able to grow our business in the long term."
Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: So there's no particular reason to think that we should see anything other than gradual increase in TAC as a percentage of both O&O and network revenue going forward. So are there any reasons why that wouldn't be the case in the next year or 2? And then, Sundar, I thought one of the more interesting innovations or that was   that kind of came out of Google I/O was visual search. And could you just talk about the   maybe a little bit the roadmap for that or the extent of which   how long it will take us actually to see that broadly in the market and what you think the appetite   or how do you think that will change the way people search for products in the future, the ability to also search visually through your phone?                                         
Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc.",".

Question: What is the roadmap for visual search?

                                                   So on the first question, there are obviously a number of factors that affect sites TAC. We've talked about them over time. The primary driver again this quarter, as you note in your question, was the strong growth in mobile and the fact that more mobile searches are subject to TAC. But the increase in sites TAC year-over-year, I think what I would stress is it really provides another lens on just how strong our mobile business is. There are other factors that affect the TAC rate, including the mix of paid versus organic traffic as well as changes in partner mix and agreement terms. But I think the main point of your question here is we do continue to expect sites TAC to increase but our focus remains on growing profit dollars.",".

Overall, for humans, the way they see, visual input is a very high bandwidth way of communicating, and so it's important that we bring that in computing. So long run I'm very bullish on it, but we're going to roll this out slowly and thoughtfully.

                                                   So Sundar, I'm just wondering if you can give us some sense of advertiser adoption, particularly among your retail clients per store visit product as it seems like there's still a large opportunity to drive off-line purchasing. And Ruth, can you give us some sense of any headwinds you might be seeing in your streams of revenue away from Play or GCP in the O&O revenue line, as we're just not that accustomed to seeing a sequentially flat revenue line there.                                         
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - Director & CEO of Google    [40]
                                                   I think I spoke about it in my opening remarks. But since store visits measurement was announced 3 years ago, advertisers have measured over 5 billion store visits globally.",.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: And I think we are just   we have just barely scratched the surface. At our Marketing Next in May, we announced that the store visits measurement will also allow for YouTube TrueView campaigns, and we'll be rolling out store sales measurement in the coming months. So advertisers can actually measure in-store revenue in addition to store visits delivered by search and shopping ads. So we've had good proof points. Advertisers who have used it   for example, Virgin Holidays used it, factored in-store sales measurements and they realized their search campaigns generate double the profit compared to looking at online KPIs alone. So I think there's a lot of opportunity there, and so we'll do more there over time.

What is Alphabet Inc's plan to generate more revenue from YouTube?"
Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: It was up nicely again this quarter, up 42% year-on-year, and that obviously includes the impact of FX. It's obviously a mix of businesses, including some of our bigger investment areas, most notably Cloud and hardware. And as I said at the outset, Play continues to perform really well. I think if you were asking about the quarter-on-quarter sequentially, you noted, we're talking about a mix of business that have different characteristics. And to state the obvious, Play is more hit driven. It's highly seasonal. Hardware is also seasonal. So the year-on-year provides a better sense of the dynamics of the business, and that's what you can see in this lineup year-on-year really nicely this quarter.

                                                   Maybe just one question for Sundar. I wonder if you could update us on your thoughts regarding the conversions of Chrome and Android operating systems. And in particular, I'm curious whether the emergence of Google Assistant and Voice as a corollary across devices is a reason to move forward with more integration between the 2 platforms.

                                                   Look, I mean we've been thoughtfully doing it, putting users first, and I'm excited at how Android apps are coming to Chromebooks. And we see that as a great opportunity, and I think that will help us deliver a very compelling experience. And we just have started doing it this year, and I expect it to really get momentum as we go through to next year.",".

Q: What are your thoughts on the conversions of Chrome and Android operating systems?
A: We're happy to see that Android apps are coming to Chromebooks, and we see that as a great opportunity."
Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: So that's an example of conversions, and I think that will work really well. And so   and in terms of products like Google Assistant and Voice, I think we will make sure, for users, it doesn't matter and that they work across every platform they use, including our platforms as well as other people's platforms. So we think about making sure our services reach as many users as possible, and so we are working on that as well.

Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: So for Sundar or Ruth, within cloud, could you talk about your view of G Suite's enterprise penetration right now, kind of key drivers of adoption longer term and if you view it as a potential differentiator for Google Cloud versus other large competitors? And then within YouTube, 60 minutes per day of viewing on phones and tablets isn't obviously incredible at that scale. Any thoughts on kind of what could drive further material viewing or engagement growth over time?                                         
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - Director & CEO of Google    [47]
                                                   Maybe on YouTube, I would say YouTube is one of those products which is scaling really well globally, just like Search did. And we are seeing real strong growth on mobile, and we are seeing real strong growth for YouTube on emerging markets as well.",".

Q: What are some key drivers of adoption for G Suite enterprise?
A: We think that there are a number of key drivers of adoption for G Suite enterprise, including the fact that it offers a comprehensive set of tools for managing email, calendar, contacts, files, and more."
Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q2 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: And we are seeing real strong growth on television. So if I look at YouTube on mobile, on emerging markets, on larger screens, they all look like newer opportunities, and so I think there's a lot more growth ahead. And on cloud, I think you have kind of answered it. Obviously, we see differentiated strengths in machine learning, data analytics, security and reliability. And the combination of not just GCP, G Suite working together with GCP, we are seeing increasing win rates and adoption across enterprise customers. And I also think all the investments we are doing in terms of broadening our ecosystem, including the newer partnerships with the companies I mentioned earlier, that should begin to pay off, and overall, the return on investment from the hiring and region expansion we are doing.",".

I frequently highlight our culture of innovation. In that regard, the most important point is that we are data-driven with an extraordinary team of engineers, product managers and designers who constantly challenge assumptions and run thousands of experiments annually to enhance user and advertiser experiences.
This approach enables us to find new opportunities given that the way consumers seek information continues to evolve. Our teams work relentlessly to anticipate and adapt to the expanding capabilities of both software and hardware.
Further, our culture of innovation is building our nonadvertising revenue streams in Cloud, Play and hardware.","

In the fourth quarter in particular, the impact of our growing hardware line will be more accentuated given the early stage of this business and the holiday seasonality. On operating expenses, we remain committed to investing to support our growing product areas.
The more modest OpEx growth in Q3 reflects both the timing of stock-based compensation and the timing of sales and marketing spend with the reality that not all investments fall neatly into a single calendar quarter.

Even though we are in the early days of AI, we are already rethinking how to build products around machine learning. It's a new paradigm compared to mobile-first software, and I'm thrilled how Google is leading the way.
Consumers can already experience how AI allows them to interact with computing more naturally than ever before. Computers are adapting to people rather than people needing to adapt to computers. Fundamental to this experience is Google Search and Assistant. We introduced Assistant last year, and it continues to get better every day, helping people get things done in the real world.","

                                                   Maybe 2 if I can. One, we see a lot of partnership announcements intra-quarter on the e-commerce side with Google Express and voice-assisted shopping on Google Home. Wanted to understand better your ambitions in e-commerce as a marketplace or a platform and how that might also feedback into the advertising business. Second question will be about the cash on the balance sheet and sort of how philosophically you think about deploying that cash against either shareholder returns or some of the big opportunities you laid out today.

We are very excited about the partnerships we are getting here with large retailers, and we're seeing traction globally. We have obviously partnered with them through our advertising products. But with shopping, especially as we move on to making shopping more seamless across mobile and newer computing categories like Google Home, I think there's tremendous interest here.

                                                   So in terms of your second question, there was really no change from the approach we've talked about previously as we think about capital allocation. The priority is organic. As you said in your question, we have a host of really exciting opportunities, and ensuring that we're investing to support long-term growth remains #1. The second is strategic, continuing to add on where it makes sense. We're pleased to have added on HTC this quarter. Acquisitions have obviously been an important part of our history.

And you provided some of the whats, but any whys behind why that growth is accelerating? Is that something that has just naturally reached the tipping point?

                                                   The Asia question. Largely, I think we've been laying a foundation for a very, very long time. Our products are very heavily used there.

We're constantly challenging assumptions. We're running a lot of experiments to enhance user and advertiser experience. And the approach continues to be productive, especially because the line of inquiry evolves as user behavior evolves.

                                                   Maybe a couple of follow-ups. First, on TAC.",.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Edited version Q3 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Wondering if changes in partner agreements, since those are one of the key drivers of the increase in TAC, could we then see the rate of TAC growth moderate as you anniversary those deals? And then secondly, as it relates to voice and visual search inputs. I know it's too early for Google Lens. But overall, wondering what portion of those search queries are proving to be incremental to search, the search experience? Or are they largely substituting for searches on screens?                                         
Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - CFO and SVP    [35]
                                                   So in terms of TAC, as I indicated, we've got a couple of things going on. We're pleased with our strong partnerships. We continue to stress the impact from the shift to mobile."," Ruth Porat:

1. Could we see the rate of TAC growth moderate as you anniversary those deals?
No, we don't anticipate that."
Edited version Q3 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: And again, I   both Sundar and I have said it, our focus remains on the profit dollar growth, and we've got a really nice position in a strong growth area. So that's what you're seeing here. But I also said we do expect it to increase some from here. Hence, we've got a couple of factors going on.                                         
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - Director & CEO of Google    [36]
                                                   On the second thing, look, I think based on every metric we see users' information need is only going up, and that amount of information they deal with are increasing. And as we add new modalities, it really drives a better experience for them. Google Lens, there's a long way to go. But today, as humans, visual input is really big for us. It means a lot higher bandwidth than everything else.",".

What is Alphabet Inc's focus?"
Edited version Q3 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: And so bringing back to computing, I think, is a really important step in advancing how users can process information. And so I see that as an important step. And thanks to machine learning, we'll be able to do these things a lot more powerfully. All of this I think, overall, adds to the search experience. And so I view that as all incremental, but it'll play out slowly over many years. And so we see this as a big opportunity ahead, and we are investing for it.

                                                   And our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.                                         
Brent John Thill,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst    [38]
                                                   The revenue growth was one of the highest growth rates you've seen in 5 years.",".

What is the company's strategy for increasing revenue growth in the future?"
Edited version Q3 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: I'm just curious if there was something that surprised you in the quarter or something that perhaps was an anomaly that we should be thinking about modeling going forward.                                         
Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - CFO and SVP    [39]
                                                   So I tried to give you a bit of color going across the major lines. We feel   we're really pleased with the sites revenue growth, the performance in mobile desktop and YouTube. I think if you just go down to the big categories, network revenue also was quite strong. I think one thing to add there is programmatic continues to be a strong contributor, generates significant growth. We've talked about that on prior calls given all the ongoing advertiser adoption of programmatic buying, and AdMob continues to see strength here. What you're also seeing here is the traditional AdSense businesses.",".

Q: What is the outlook for programmatic?
A: We continue to see strong growth in programmatic."
Edited version Q3 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: And overall, the pace of advertiser migration to programmatic affects this business kind of quarter-on-quarter as well as the policy changes that we've talked about in prior quarters. And those factors were less of a drag in the last couple of quarters. So you actually saw nicer revenue growth year-on-year here as well. It's up 16%. And then Sundar has talked a lot about the components of other revenues up nicely. We're really pleased with what's going on there. And then on top of that, Other Bets have got a couple of components to it. I tried to give you color on each one.

                                                   And our final question comes from the line of Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse.                                         
Stephen D.",".

What is the company's outlook for programmatic advertising?

The company's outlook for programmatic advertising is positive."

                                                   So Sundar, can you talk about how Google's positioning in the emerging markets over the longer term can be different versus what we are used to seeing here in The States? I mean, you talked about Tez in India. And that's just the type of stuff that we're not even seeing here in The States.",".

What is Google's strategy for differentiating itself in the emerging markets?"
Edited version Q3 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: So is there a broader opportunity for you to do a larger land grab with more products? And Ruth, should we assume that the relative size of the dollar contribution to the other revenue growth happened in the order you gave out in the prepared remarks? I guess, Cloud, Play, hardware? And if so, this would make it the second quarter in a row in which Cloud is showing up as the largest contributor, I guess, as opposed to the third. So any perspective you can share in terms of the relative growth you may be seeing recently?                                         
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc.",".

Question: What is the relative growth you may be seeing recently for Cloud?
Answer: Cloud is showing up as the largest contributor, I guess, as opposed to the third."
Edited version Q3 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q3 2017 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: - Director & CEO of Google    [42]
                                                   On emerging markets, we do see differentiated opportunity there, partly because the characteristics of how truly many of these markets became mobile first, I think, gives rise to different ways users are adopting our products. And also, more importantly, the ecosystem, which it's built around. So for example, if you take e-commerce, the kind of models that are emerging in these countries are also a bit different. So I think we see a way to look at these markets with a lot more thought and address them for the opportunities that they have, not just apply our global products there. So I think that's what led us to do Google Tez in India, and we'll thoughtfully look at the opportunities in that region and invest a lot in the years ahead.",".

Q: What do you think are the unique opportunities in emerging markets for Google?
A: We see a way to look at these markets with a lot more thought and address them for the opportunities that they have, not just apply our global products there."

                                                   And then we do   we did list them in the order in which they're making a contribution. It's obviously a mix of businesses. And as we've talked about, we have very strong growth in each of Cloud and hardware that was tempered by slightly slower growth in Q3 for Play, reflecting what's the hit-driven nature of that business of gaming. But again, I feel really pleased with the progress, momentum that we're seeing in the various businesses. And I guess, the only other thing to note is obvious seasonality on the hardware as we move into the fourth quarter here.

Q: Ruth, what are your thoughts on the state of the advertising market?
A: We're seeing some good growth in the advertising market, but we're still seeing some challenges. We're seeing more competition from other platforms and we're seeing more fragmentation in the market. We're seeing more people using ad blockers, which is impacting our revenue. We're seeing more people using video as their primary form of advertising, which is also impacting our revenue. We're seeing more people using programmatic advertising, which is also impacting our revenue. We're seeing more people using artificial intelligence to target their ads, which is also impacting our revenue. We're seeing more people using chatbots, which is also impacting our revenue. So there are a lot of different things that are impacting our revenue, and we're trying to figure out how to address all of those things."

                                                   Thank you, Ellen. We delivered ongoing strong revenue growth, up 26% year-on-year and up 23% in constant currency. The sustained outstanding performance in sites revenues, in particular, reflects the combined benefits of innovation and secular growth, with mobile search again leading the way. Robust growth in network revenues was again led by our programmatic business.",". Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: What was the main driver of revenue growth in Q1 2018? A. The sustained outstanding performance in sites revenues, in particular, reflects the combined benefits of innovation and secular growth. 
A. The main driver of revenue growth in Q1 2018 was the combined benefits of innovation and secular growth."
Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Ongoing substantial growth in other revenues, namely cloud, hardware and Play, continues to highlight the growing contribution of our non-ads opportunities.
Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. Second, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. As we highlighted in our earnings press release, our results this quarter were affected by a new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments. I'll highlight the impact on particular line items as I review the quarter. I will then conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions.
Starting with the summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $31.1 billion were up 26% year-over-year.",".

Q: What was the main driver of revenue growth for Alphabet?
A: The main driver of revenue growth for Alphabet was growth in other revenues, namely cloud, hardware and Play."
Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: We realized the positive currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $1.3 billion or $1.1 billion after the impact of our hedging program.
Turning to Alphabet's revenue by geography. You can see that our performance was strong again in all regions. U.S. revenues were $14.1 billion, up 20% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $10.5 billion, up 29% year-over-year. In constant currency terms, EMEA grew 21%, reflecting strengthening of both the euro and the British pound. APAC revenues were $4.8 billion, up 33% versus last year and up 30% in constant currency, reflecting strengthening of the Japanese yen and Australian dollar. Other America revenues were $1.7 billion, up 36% year-over-year and up 35% in constant currency.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, was $13.5 billion, up 37% year-on-year.",".

What was the positive currency impact on Alphabet's revenues year-over-year of $1.3 billion or $1.1 billion after the impact of their hedging program?
The positive currency impact was the difference between the revenues generated in U.S. dollars and the same revenues generated in other currencies, which was $1.1 billion."
Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.2 billion, up 39% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The key drivers were: first, costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, which was affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses primarily from G&A; second, content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube; and finally, hardware-related costs.
Operating expenses were $10.7 billion, up 27% year-over-year, with the biggest increase in R&D expenses reflecting our continued investment in technical talent.",".

What was the biggest driver of operating expenses? 
The biggest driver of operating expenses was costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, which was affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses primarily from G&A."
Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects advertising investments in cloud and hardware as well as the Assistant.
G&A expense trends were affected this quarter by a number of factors, in particular, performance fees accrued in connection with the recognition of equity security gains, which were partially offset by the reallocation of certain expenses from G&A, primarily the other cost of revenues and the benefit of the Uber litigation settlement.

The opportunity set ahead of us is quite extraordinary, and we remain focused on investment to support long-term revenue and profit growth.

Within OpEx, as I said last quarter, we are continuing to support our priority investment areas. Within R&D, this is reflected in increased headcount, particularly for technical roles. Sales and marketing is similarly elevated to support these areas, both in the quarter and for the full year, and we expect expenses to remain more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year to support the holiday season.

Third, with respect to CapEx. Our commitment to growth is evident in the trend in CapEx investment, almost equally split this quarter between compute capacity and facilities.",".

What is the impact of the accrual for performance fees related to the equity gains previously discussed?
The impact of the accrual for performance fees related to the equity gains previously discussed is that it has decreased the amount of cash available for other costs of revenues."
Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: Our facilities spent in Google dominated by the Chelsea Market acquisition reflects that we favor owning rather than leasing real estate when we see good opportunities.

We are also investing in data center growth and increased network capacity through undersea cables. These combined investments will expand our compute capacity to support our growth outlook across Google, including machine learning, the Assistant and cloud.
In many respects, these investments underscore my opening comment about both our confidence and clarity about future opportunities with our focus on proprietary solutions that enable us to deliver the secure, reliable, high-performing compute infrastructure to support new and emerging products and services for our users, advertisers and enterprise customers.

And then on cloud, Sundar, you had mentioned you're seeing a lot of momentum. You said G Suite, I believe, accelerated in Q1. I was wondering if there was any color on the GCP side that you could share from a growth perspective if that business accelerated or not and kind of how were the deal sites trending for that business in particular.

Things worth I would call out is we are seeing larger deals as well. We are seeing good synergies between G Suite and cloud. Areas where we have done acquisitions like Apigee, they are beginning to work in terms of driving synergies to cloud.

Across the regions, it is obviously one of the smaller ones, so growing at a slightly faster clip and really pleased with the broad strength there. It starts with the sites revenue strength. But on top of that, they benefited from hardware devices launching in some additional markets over the past year.

Anthony DiClemente - Evercore ISI: So I wanted to ask about the slowdown in TAC growth. Can you give us a little more color on what's driving that slowdown?

Brian Krzanich - Alphabet Inc.: Sure. So, I think there are a couple things at play here. One is that we're seeing some stabilization in the number of new devices that are being launched, and that's been a pretty consistent trend over the past year or so. And then there's also been a slowdown in the rate of growth in spending on software and services. So, both of those things are contributing to a slowdown in TAC growth.

Anthony DiClemente - Evercore ISI: Okay. And then just one follow-up on that. You mentioned that you're seeing stabilization in the number of new devices. Can you give us a little more color on what's driving that stabilization?

Brian Krzanich - Alphabet Inc.: So, I think part of it is that people are waiting for the next big thing to come out. And so, they're not necessarily rushing out and buying new devices. And then, also, we've seen some shifts in the market where some devices are being replaced by other devices. So, there's been a bit of a mix of things going on."

Ruth, on CapEx, even if we exclude the Chelsea Market one-timer, the gross in CapEx, is it really substantial even on a kind of recurring basis.

So in particular, it's the expanding application of the machine learning efforts across Alphabet, plus the requirements for cloud and Search and YouTube, and then secondarily, the increased cost of newer technologies, CPUs, memory, network.

                                                   Oh, so I think we announced the   this new service in March, and the feedback has been very positive. I mentioned earlier, which is for retailers, when they are testing this, they see it drives an increase in basket size. So that means users are interacting with the product well, and that's all I have to share for now. It's still early days.

I think you mentioned that you're seeing some good traction there. Can you give us a little bit more color on that?                                           
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - Director & CEO of Google    [30]

We're seeing people using it for multiple purposes, including for entertainment, for work, and for productivity. So we're seeing good early signs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     "
Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: I was wondering if you could provide any color, at least in the relative momentum you're seeing in that segment from infrastructure services compared to platform or software services. And then related to the adoption of AMP. I guess, a key question we get asked is whether that ultimately changes usage, and maybe you have some perspective on this from Android. But in the ecosystem between mobile web pages and app usage, if you're seeing any shift among users between those formats.                                         
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - Director & CEO of Google    [30]
                                                   On the first question of cloud, look, I mean, I think the main thing I would say is the fundamental drivers of adoption of Google Cloud based on what we hear back from customers is our advantage in data analytics and machine learning.",".

Question: What is the advantage of Google Cloud in data analytics and machine learning?
Answer: Our advantage is our ability to provide data analytics and machine learning services that are superior to those of our competitors."
Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: The fact that we really support open, agile development environment. Kubernetes has literally become the standard for workloads and the fact that we are open in terms of how we approach this space. Security is becoming a big differentiator for us and something we've been leading for a while, and I think that's driving it. G Suite, as I called out earlier, is a good synergistic driver. G Suite is doing well, and clearly, a very unique offering, and it's gotten very comprehensive. And so I think overall, it comes together well. On your second question around AMP, AMP has been definitely very successful. It's really made publisher content much more friendly for users in terms of latency and the user experience, and hence, that option has been great.","

What do you think is the biggest differentiator for Alphabet Inc when it comes to competing in the cloud services market?"
Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: For sure, AMP has definitely helped the mobile web, and that's part of the big reasons we did it. Mobile web is still a big part of how users consume content, especially around news, and so us investing there clearly makes a difference. I guess, for example, when we look at, I don't know, J.Crew adopted AMP, their mobile page loading times are now over 90% faster. And now they are integrating the Google payment request API. That reduces checkout times from 2 minutes to 30 seconds or so. So things like that. We are going to constantly stay on improving the mobile web, and that plays a big part in how our ecosystem works.

                                                   I have 2, one for Sundar, one for Ruth. First, Sundar, can you give us any sense of how Google Home consumers are using Search in these devices differently than maybe the traditional ways of Search? And you're finding in those homes, is it additive to overall search activity? And then for Ruth, if you look at the last page of press release, where you've shown the new monetization metrics, you see a real increase in the cost per impression on network sites. So can you talk about maybe what's happening there? Is there a mix shift types of publishers, types of products? Or is that just market inflation?                                         
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc.",".

Q: What's happening with cost per impression on network sites?
A: The cost per impression on network sites is increasing because there is a mix shift of publishers, types of products, and types of users."

                                                   Look, for sure, Google Home gives rise to a lot of new and unique use cases, actions that are a big part of it. Call mom is a good example of something you say to Google Home a lot. I can   which is different than what you would say to Search. We see this as a good complementary thing. You will see Search embrace some of the capabilities you find in Google Assistant and Google Home and vice versa. And so overall, I view this as additive in the long term, and we are definitely just getting started there.

                                                   And then on the network monetization trends. First, just to give people a bit more color.",".

Q: What is Alphabet Inc.'s network monetization strategy?
A: Alphabet Inc.'s network monetization strategy includes developing and marketing advertising products, such as Google Ads, and charging for access to its search engine and other online services."
Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: When we launched the AdSense businesses, our network revenues were largely click-based. And over time, there's been a meaningful mix change in our business given the strong growth in programmatic, which is impression-based. So as a result, the shift now covers more of the business. And then in terms of the question on impression growth versus CPM growth, as we've discussed on prior calls, the network business is actually a number of different businesses. And then within that, we have flat year-on-year growth in the number of impressions that was driven by efforts to improve user experience through a reduction of less relevant ads and AFC. And so these changes had a positive impact on the year-on-year growth in CPMs.",".

Question: What is the impact of the shift to impression-based advertising on CPM growth?

Answer: The shift to impression-based advertising has had a positive impact on the year-on-year growth in CPMs."
Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: And then the trend and impressions in CPMs can clearly be volatile from quarter-to-quarter as we're optimizing for the user publisher and advertiser, but it really goes to the efforts that we make.

                                                   Just as a question regarding any changes on your framework for growth versus operating margins. The last few quarters, you've seen steady top line acceleration, yet the margins were down. Can you just talk about how you think about it at a high level for this year? Any changes from the past?

                                                   Yes, it's an important question.",.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: As we've talked about on many, many calls, we have been and remain focused on supporting long-term revenue and profit growth, and we think the opportunity set ahead of us is quite extraordinary. And as I said in opening comments, just given our confidence and as we're looking forward, we want to make sure we're investing appropriately in the next phase of innovation, and we have clarity about some very compelling opportunities. And then our judgment, that enables us to maximize shareholder value. So we're taking the steps really to put in place the support for long-term   longer-term growth. Part of what I'm saying, you can see in our sites revenue growth, try to make that clear in opening comments, we see this consistent, strong momentum globally, and we're really excited about the still sizable opportunity led by mobile search.",".

Question: Can you give us a little more color on the mobile search opportunity?

Answer: So we think there's still a lot of opportunity in mobile search. We continue to see really strong growth in mobile search, and we think that there's a lot of opportunity to continue to grow that."
Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: And so we're continuing to invest to enhance the user and advertiser experience, and thereby, extend the growth in our ads business. You can see this also in the trend on the CapEx spend. As I noted in our opening comments, the investments we're making there really provide the compute capacity to support our growth outlook, and that's supporting the opportunities that come out of machine learning and the Assistant. And then we also see extraordinary upside in the newer markets, as Sundar has talked about, most notably cloud computing and hardware. And so we're investing to support the long-term growth opportunity there. And then finally, when we look at the market opportunity in both self-driving cars and life sciences, our judgment is it makes sense to place the kinds of investments that we are.",".

Answer: Alphabet Inc's CapEx spend for ads business is $2.5 billion."
Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: And with all of this, what also hasn't changed is we appreciate the importance of prioritization and picking our spots, and we're keenly focused on steps we can take to both make the right investments with the proper intensity while being diligent about long-term plans and returns.

                                                   So Sundar, I think one of the themes that you as a management team has talked about has been to, I guess, democratize advertising with AI to help SMBs who may have found advertising across Google's ad products to be perhaps overwhelming."," that would help clarify that.

What Sundar said is that the company is continuing to prioritize making the right investments with the proper intensity while also being diligent about long-term plans and returns."
Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call," Edited version Q1 2018 Alphabet Inc Earnings Call: So can you talk about the rate of uptake among the smaller advertisers and whether or not this is helping to catalyze growth in new budgets and where these guys might otherwise have not been able to advertise before? There's SMBs and then there's local also. So what will be the plan to get this technology into the hands of folks who will want to use them?
